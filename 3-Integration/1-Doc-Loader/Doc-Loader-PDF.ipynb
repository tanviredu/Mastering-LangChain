DL has the potential to transform DIA pipelines and benefit a broad\\nspectrum of large-scale document digitization projects.\\nHowever, there are several practical difficulties for taking advantages of re-\\ncent advances in DL-based methods: 1) DL models are notoriously convoluted\\nfor reuse and extension. Existing models are developed using distinct frame-\\nworks like TensorFlow [1] or PyTorch [24], and the high-level parameters can\\nbe obfuscated by implementation details [8]. It can be a time-consuming and\\nfrustrating experience to debug, reproduce, and adapt existing models for DIA,\\nand many researchers who would benefit the most from using these methods lack\\nthe technical background to implement them from scratch. 2) Document images\\ncontain diverse and disparate patterns across domains, and customized training\\nis often required to achieve a desirable detection accuracy. Currently there is no\\nfull-fledged infrastructure for easily curating the target document image datasets\\nand fine-tuning or re-training the models. 3) DIA usually requires a sequence of\\nmodelsandotherprocessingtoobtainthefinaloutputs.Oftenresearchteamsuse\\nDL models and then perform further document analyses in separate processes,\\nand these pipelines are not documented in any central location (and often not\\ndocumented at all). This makes it difficult for research teams to learn about how\\nfull pipelines are implemented and leads them to invest significant resources in\\nreinventing the DIA wheel.\\nLayoutParserprovidesaunifiedtoolkittosupportDL-baseddocumentimage\\nanalysisandprocessing.Toaddresstheaforementionedchallenges,LayoutParser\\nis built with the following components:\\n1.

Different\\nfrom traditional methods, it relies on deep convolutional neural networks rather\\nthan manually curated rules to identify content regions. It is formulated as an\\nobject detection problem and state-of-the-art models like Faster R-CNN [28] and\\nMask R-CNN [12] are used. This yields prediction results of high accuracy and\\nmakes it possible to build a concise, generalized interface for layout detection.\\nLayoutParser, built upon Detectron2 [35], provides a minimal API that can\\nperform layout detection with only four lines of code in Python:\\n1 import layoutparser as lp\\n2 image = cv2.imread(\"image_file\") # load images\\n3 model = lp.Detectron2LayoutModel(\\n4 \"lp://PubLayNet/faster_rcnn_R_50_FPN_3x/config\")\\n5 layout = model.detect(image)\\nLayoutParser provides a wealth of pre-trained model weights using various\\ndatasets covering different languages, time periods, and document types.

End-users can upload their self-trained models to the model hub,\\nand these models can be loaded into a similar interface as the currently available\\nLayoutParser pre-trained models. For example, the model trained on the News\\nNavigator dataset [17] has been incorporated in the model hub.\\nBeyond DL models, LayoutParser also promotes the sharing of entire doc-\\nument digitization pipelines. For example, sometimes the pipeline requires the\\ncombinationofmultipleDLmodelstoachievebetteraccuracy.Currently,pipelines\\nare mainly described in academic papers and implementations are often not pub-\\nlicly available. To this end, the LayoutParser community platform also enables\\nthe sharing of layout pipelines to promote the discussion and reuse of techniques.\\nFor each shared pipeline, it has a dedicated project page, with links to the source\\ncode, documentation, and an outline of the approaches. A discussion panel is\\nprovided for exchanging ideas. Combined with the core LayoutParser library,\\nusers can easily build reusable components based on the shared pipelines and\\napply them to solve their unique problems.\\n5 Use Cases\\nThecoreobjectiveof LayoutParseristomakeiteasiertocreatebothlarge-scale\\nandlight-weightdocumentdigitizationpipelines.Large-scaledocumentprocessing\\n'),\n",

Shen et al.\\nTodecipherthecomplicatedlayout\\nstructure, two object detection models have been trained to recognize individual\\ncolumns and tokens, respectively. A small training set (400 images with approxi-\\nmately 100 annotations each) is curated via the active learning based annotation\\ntool [32] in LayoutParser. The models learn to identify both the categories and\\nregions for each token or column via their distinct visual features. The layout\\ndata structure enables easy grouping of the tokens within each column, and\\nrearrangingcolumnstoachievethecorrectreadingordersbasedonthehorizontal\\nposition. Errors are identified and rectified via checking the consistency of the\\nmodel predictions. Therefore, though trained on a small dataset, the pipeline\\nachieves a high level of layout detection accuracy: it achieves a 96.97 AP [19]\\nscore across 5 categories for the column detection model, and a 89.23 AP across\\n4 categories for the token detection model.\\nA combination of character recognition methods is developed to tackle the\\nunique challenges in this document. In our experiments, we found that irregular\\nspacing between the tokens led to a lowcharacter recognition recall rate, whereas\\nexisting OCR models tend to perform better on densely-arranged texts. To\\novercome this challenge, we create a document reorganization algorithm that\\nrearranges the text based on the token bounding boxes detected in the layout\\nanalysis step. Figure 4 (b) illustrates the generated image of dense text, which is\\nsent to the OCR APIs as a whole to reduce the transaction costs. The flexible\\ncoordinatesysteminLayoutParserisusedtotransformtheOCRresultsrelative\\nto their original positions on the page.\\nAdditionally, it is common for historical documents to use unique fonts\\nwith different glyphs, which significantly degrades the accuracy of OCR models\\ntrained on modern texts. In this document, a special flat font is used for printing\\nnumbersandcouldnotbedetectedbyoff-the-shelfOCRengines.Usingthehighly\\nflexible functionalities from LayoutParser, a pipeline approach is constructed\\nthat achieves a high recognition accuracy with minimal effort. As the characters\\nhave unique visual structures and are usually clustered together, we train the\\nlayout model to identify number regions with a dedicated category. Subsequently,\\nLayoutParsercropsimageswithintheseregions,andidentifiescharacterswithin\\nthem using a self-trained OCR model based on a CNN-RNN [6]. The model\\ndetects a total of 15 possible categories, and achieves a 0.98 Jaccard score16 and\\na 0.17 average Levinstein distances17 for token prediction on the test set.\\nOverall, it is possible to create an intricate and highly accurate digitization\\npipeline for large-scale digitization using LayoutParser. The pipeline avoids\\nspecifying the complicated rules used in traditional methods, is straightforward\\nto develop, and is robust to outliers. The DL models also generate fine-grained\\nresults that enable creative approaches like page reorganization for OCR.\\n16 This measures the overlap between the detected and ground-truth characters, and\\nthe maximum is 1.\\n17 This measures the number of edits from the ground-truth text to the predicted text,\\nand lower is better.\\n'),\n",

Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been\\nprimarily driven by the application of neural networks. Ideally, research\\noutcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further\\ninvestigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases\\nand sophisticated model conﬁgurations complicate the easy reuse of im-\\nportant innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going\\neﬀorts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model\\ndevelopment in disciplines like natural language processing and computer\\nvision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA.\\nThis represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to\\nacademic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences\\nand humanities. This paper introduces LayoutParser, an open-source\\nlibrary for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applica-\\ntions. The core LayoutParser library comes with a set of simple and\\nintuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models for layout de-\\ntection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks.\\nTo promote extensibility, LayoutParser also incorporates a community\\nplatform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digiti-\\nzation pipelines.

DL has the potential to transform DIA pipelines and beneﬁt a broad\\nspectrum of large-scale document digitization projects.\\nHowever, there are several practical diﬃculties for taking advantages of re-\\ncent advances in DL-based methods: 1) DL models are notoriously convoluted\\nfor reuse and extension. Existing models are developed using distinct frame-\\nworks like TensorFlow [1] or PyTorch [ 24], and the high-level parameters can\\nbe obfuscated by implementation details [ 8]. It can be a time-consuming and\\nfrustrating experience to debug, reproduce, and adapt existing models for DIA,\\nand many researchers who would beneﬁt the most from using these methods lack\\nthe technical background to implement them from scratch. 2) Document images\\ncontain diverse and disparate patterns across domains, and customized training\\nis often required to achieve a desirable detection accuracy. Currently there is no\\nfull-ﬂedged infrastructure for easily curating the target document image datasets\\nand ﬁne-tuning or re-training the models. 3) DIA usually requires a sequence of\\nmodels and other processing to obtain the ﬁnal outputs. Often research teams use\\nDL models and then perform further document analyses in separate processes,\\nand these pipelines are not documented in any central location (and often not\\ndocumented at all). This makes it diﬃcult for research teams to learn about how\\nfull pipelines are implemented and leads them to invest signiﬁcant resources in\\nreinventing the DIA wheel .\\nLayoutParser provides a uniﬁed toolkit to support DL-based document image\\nanalysis and processing. To address the aforementioned challenges,LayoutParser\\nis built with the following components:\\n1. An oﬀ-the-shelf toolkit for applying DL models for layout detection, character\\nrecognition, and other DIA tasks (Section 3)\\n2. A rich repository of pre-trained neural network models (Model Zoo) that\\nunderlies the oﬀ-the-shelf usage\\n3. Comprehensive tools for eﬃcient document image data annotation and model\\ntuning to support diﬀerent levels of customization\\n4. A DL model hub and community platform for the easy sharing, distribu-\\ntion, and discussion of DIA models and pipelines, to promote reusability,\\nreproducibility, and extensibility (Section 4)\\nThe library implements simple and intuitive Python APIs without sacriﬁcing\\ngeneralizability and versatility, and can be easily installed via pip. Its convenient\\nfunctions for handling document image data can be seamlessly integrated with\\nexisting DIA pipelines. With detailed documentations and carefully curated\\ntutorials, we hope this tool will beneﬁt a variety of end-users, and will lead to\\nadvances in applications in both industry and academic research.\\nLayoutParser is well aligned with recent eﬀorts for improving DL model\\nreusability in other disciplines like natural language processing [ 8, 34] and com-\\nputer vision [ 35], but with a focus on unique challenges in DIA.

The dhSegment [ 22] utilizes fully convolutional networks [ 20] for segmen-\\ntation tasks on historical documents. Object detection-based methods like Faster\\nR-CNN [28] and Mask R-CNN [12] are used for identifying document elements [38]\\nand detecting tables [30, 26]. Most recently, Graph Neural Networks [29] have also\\nbeen used in table detection [ 27]. However, these models are usually implemented\\nindividually and there is no uniﬁed framework to load and use such models.\\nThere has been a surge of interest in creating open-source tools for document\\nimage processing: a search of document image analysis in Github leads to 5M\\nrelevant code pieces 6; yet most of them rely on traditional rule-based methods\\nor provide limited functionalities. The closest prior research to our work is the\\nOCR-D project7, which also tries to build a complete toolkit for DIA. However,\\nsimilar to the platform developed by Neudecker et al. [ 21], it is designed for\\nanalyzing historical documents, and provides no supports for recent DL models.\\nThe DocumentLayoutAnalysis project8 focuses on processing born-digital PDF\\ndocuments via analyzing the stored PDF data. Repositories like DeepLayout9\\nand Detectron2-PubLayNet10 are individual deep learning models trained on\\nlayout analysis datasets without support for the full DIA pipeline. The Document\\nAnalysis and Exploitation (DAE) platform [ 15] and the DeepDIVA project [ 2]\\naim to improve the reproducibility of DIA methods (or DL models), yet they\\nare not actively maintained. OCR engines like Tesseract [14], easyOCR11 and\\npaddleOCR12 usually do not come with comprehensive functionalities for other\\nDIA tasks like layout analysis.\\nRecent years have also seen numerous eﬀorts to create libraries for promoting\\nreproducibility and reusability in the ﬁeld of DL.

We now provide detailed descriptions for each\\ncomponent.\\n3.1 Layout Detection Models\\nIn LayoutParser, a layout model takes a document image as an input and\\ngenerates a list of rectangular boxes for the target content regions. Diﬀerent\\nfrom traditional methods, it relies on deep convolutional neural networks rather\\nthan manually curated rules to identify content regions. It is formulated as an\\nobject detection problem and state-of-the-art models like Faster R-CNN [ 28] and\\nMask R-CNN [12] are used. This yields prediction results of high accuracy and\\nmakes it possible to build a concise, generalized interface for layout detection.\\nLayoutParser, built upon Detectron2 [ 35], provides a minimal API that can\\nperform layout detection with only four lines of code in Python:\\n1 import layoutparser as lp\\n2 image = cv2 . imread (\" image_file \") # load images\\n3 model = lp. Detectron2LayoutModel (\\n4 \"lp :// PubLayNet / faster_rcnn_R_50_FPN_3x / config \")\\n5 layout = model . detect ( image )\\nLayoutParser provides a wealth of pre-trained model weights using various\\ndatasets covering diﬀerent languages, time periods, and document types. Due to\\ndomain shift [7], the prediction performance can notably drop when models are ap-\\nplied to target samples that are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the training dataset. As\\ndocument structures and layouts vary greatly in diﬀerent domains, it is important\\nto select models trained on a dataset similar to the test samples. A semantic syntax\\nis used for initializing the model weights in LayoutParser, using both the dataset\\nname and model name lp://<dataset-name>/<model-architecture-name>.'),\n",

Description of the training dataset is provided alongside\\nwith the trained models such that users can quickly identify the most suitable\\nmodels for their tasks. Additionally, when such a model is not readily available,\\nLayoutParser also supports training customized layout models and community\\nsharing of the models (detailed in Section 3.5).\\n3.2 Layout Data Structures\\nA critical feature of LayoutParser is the implementation of a series of data\\nstructures and operations that can be used to eﬃciently process and manipulate\\nthe layout elements. In document image analysis pipelines, various post-processing\\non the layout analysis model outputs is usually required to obtain the ﬁnal\\noutputs. Traditionally, this requires exporting DL model outputs and then loading\\nthe results into other pipelines. All model outputs from LayoutParser will be\\nstored in carefully engineered data types optimized for further processing, which\\nmakes it possible to build an end-to-end document digitization pipeline within\\nLayoutParser. There are three key components in the data structure, namely\\nthe Coordinate system, the TextBlock, and the Layout. They provide diﬀerent\\nlevels of abstraction for the layout data, and a set of APIs are supported for\\ntransformations or operations on these classes.'),\n",

Currently,\\nthree types of Coordinate data structures are provided in LayoutParser, shown\\nin Figure 2. Interval and Rectangle are the most common data types and\\nsupport specifying 1D or 2D regions within a document. They are parameterized\\nwith 2 and 4 parameters. A Quadrilateral class is also implemented to support\\na more generalized representation of rectangular regions when the document\\nis skewed or distorted, where the 4 corner points can be speciﬁed and a total\\nof 8 degrees of freedom are supported. A wide collection of transformations\\nlike shift, pad, and scale, and operations like intersect, union, and is_in,\\nare supported for these classes. Notably, it is common to separate a segment\\nof the image and analyze it individually. LayoutParser provides full support\\nfor this scenario via image cropping operations crop_image and coordinate\\ntransformations like relative_to and condition_on that transform coordinates\\nto and from their relative representations. We refer readers to Table 2 for a more\\ndetailed description of these operations 13.\\nBased on Coordinates, we implement the TextBlock class that stores both\\nthe positional and extra features of individual layout elements. It also supports\\nspecifying the reading orders via setting theparent ﬁeld to the index of the parent\\nobject. A Layout class is built that takes in a list of TextBlocks and supports\\nprocessing the elements in batch.Layout can also be nested to support hierarchical\\nlayout structures. They support the same operations and transformations as the\\nCoordinate classes, minimizing both learning and deployment eﬀort.\\n3.3 OCR\\nLayoutParser provides a uniﬁed interface for existing OCR tools. Though there\\nare many OCR tools available, they are usually conﬁgured diﬀerently with distinct\\nAPIs or protocols for using them. It can be ineﬃcient to add new OCR tools into\\nan existing pipeline, and diﬃcult to make direct comparisons among the available\\ntools to ﬁnd the best option for a particular project. To this end, LayoutParser\\nbuilds a series of wrappers among existing OCR engines, and provides nearly\\nthe same syntax for using them. It supports a plug-and-play style of using OCR\\nengines, making it eﬀortless to switch, evaluate, and compare diﬀerent OCR\\nmodules:\\n1 ocr_agent = lp.

LayoutParser supports exporting layout data into diﬀerent\\nformats like JSON, csv, and will add the support for the METS/ALTO XML\\nformat 14 . It can also load datasets from layout analysis-speciﬁc formats like\\nCOCO [38] and the Page Format [25] for training layout models (Section 3.5).\\nVisualization of the layout detection results is critical for both presentation\\nand debugging.

The rest of\\nthe regions are automatically annotated with high conﬁdence predictions from\\nthe layout detection model. This allows a layout dataset to be created more\\neﬃciently with only around 60% of the labeling budget.\\nAfter the training dataset is curated, LayoutParser supports diﬀerent modes\\nfor training the layout models. Fine-tuning can be used for training models on a\\nsmall newly-labeled dataset by initializing the model with existing pre-trained\\nweights. Training from scratch can be helpful when the source dataset and\\ntarget are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent and a large training set is available. However, as\\nsuggested in Studer et al.’s work[ 33], loading pre-trained weights on large-scale\\ndatasets like ImageNet [5], even from totally diﬀerent domains, can still boost\\nmodel performance.

Similar to many existing deep learning\\nlibraries, LayoutParser comes with a community model hub for distributing\\nlayout models. End-users can upload their self-trained models to the model hub,\\nand these models can be loaded into a similar interface as the currently available\\nLayoutParser pre-trained models.

For example, sometimes the pipeline requires the\\ncombination of multiple DL models to achieve better accuracy. Currently, pipelines\\nare mainly described in academic papers and implementations are often not pub-\\nlicly available. To this end, the LayoutParser community platform also enables\\nthe sharing of layout pipelines to promote the discussion and reuse of techniques.\\nFor each shared pipeline, it has a dedicated project page, with links to the source\\ncode, documentation, and an outline of the approaches. A discussion panel is\\nprovided for exchanging ideas.

Yet due to\\nscan noises, page wearing, and the prevalence of complicated layout structures, ob-\\ntaining a structured representation of historical document scans is often extremely\\ncomplicated.\\nFig. 5: Illustration of how LayoutParser\\nhelps with the historical document digi-\\ntization pipeline.\\nIn this example, LayoutParser was\\nused to develop a comprehensive\\npipeline, shown in Figure 5, to gener-\\nate high-quality structured data from\\nhistorical Japanese ﬁrm ﬁnancial ta-\\nbles with complicated layouts. The\\npipeline applies two layout models to\\nidentify diﬀerent levels of document\\nstructures and two customized OCR\\nengines for optimized character recog-\\nnition accuracy.\\nAs shown in Figure 4 (a), the\\ndocument contains columns of text\\nwritten vertically 15, a common style\\nin Japanese. Due to scanning noise\\nand archaic printing technology, the\\ncolumns can be skewed or have vari-\\nable widths, and hence cannot be eas-\\nily identiﬁed via rule-based methods.\\nWithin each column, words are sepa-\\nrated by white spaces of variable size,\\nand the vertical positions of objects\\ncan be an indicator of their layout\\ntype.\\n15 A document page consists of eight rows like this.

Shen et al.\\nTo decipher the complicated layout\\nstructure, two object detection models have been trained to recognize individual\\ncolumns and tokens, respectively. A small training set (400 images with approxi-\\nmately 100 annotations each) is curated via the active learning based annotation\\ntool [32] in LayoutParser. The models learn to identify both the categories and\\nregions for each token or column via their distinct visual features. The layout\\ndata structure enables easy grouping of the tokens within each column, and\\nrearranging columns to achieve the correct reading orders based on the horizontal\\nposition. Errors are identiﬁed and rectiﬁed via checking the consistency of the\\nmodel predictions. Therefore, though trained on a small dataset, the pipeline\\nachieves a high level of layout detection accuracy: it achieves a 96.97 AP [ 19]\\nscore across 5 categories for the column detection model, and a 89.23 AP across\\n4 categories for the token detection model.\\nA combination of character recognition methods is developed to tackle the\\nunique challenges in this document. In our experiments, we found that irregular\\nspacing between the tokens led to a low character recognition recall rate, whereas\\nexisting OCR models tend to perform better on densely-arranged texts. To\\novercome this challenge, we create a document reorganization algorithm that\\nrearranges the text based on the token bounding boxes detected in the layout\\nanalysis step. Figure 4 (b) illustrates the generated image of dense text, which is\\nsent to the OCR APIs as a whole to reduce the transaction costs. The ﬂexible\\ncoordinate system in LayoutParser is used to transform the OCR results relative\\nto their original positions on the page.\\nAdditionally, it is common for historical documents to use unique fonts\\nwith diﬀerent glyphs, which signiﬁcantly degrades the accuracy of OCR models\\ntrained on modern texts. In this document, a special ﬂat font is used for printing\\nnumbers and could not be detected by oﬀ-the-shelf OCR engines. Using the highly\\nﬂexible functionalities from LayoutParser, a pipeline approach is constructed\\nthat achieves a high recognition accuracy with minimal eﬀort. As the characters\\nhave unique visual structures and are usually clustered together, we train the\\nlayout model to identify number regions with a dedicated category. Subsequently,\\nLayoutParser crops images within these regions, and identiﬁes characters within\\nthem using a self-trained OCR model based on a CNN-RNN [ 6]. The model\\ndetects a total of 15 possible categories, and achieves a 0.98 Jaccard score 16 and\\na 0.17 average Levinstein distances 17 for token prediction on the test set.\\nOverall, it is possible to create an intricate and highly accurate digitization\\npipeline for large-scale digitization using LayoutParser. The pipeline avoids\\nspecifying the complicated rules used in traditional methods, is straightforward\\nto develop, and is robust to outliers. The DL models also generate ﬁne-grained\\nresults that enable creative approaches like page reorganization for OCR.\\n16 This measures the overlap between the detected and ground-truth characters, and\\nthe maximum is 1.\\n17 This measures the number of edits from the ground-truth text to the predicted text,\\nand lower is better.'),\n",

In very few cases (d), it\\nmight generate minor error predictions, e.g, failing to capture the top text line of\\na table.\\n5.2 A light-weight Visual Table Extractor\\nDetecting tables and parsing their structures (table extraction) are of central im-\\nportance for many document digitization tasks. Many previous works [ 26, 30, 27]\\nand tools 18 have been developed to identify and parse table structures. Yet they\\nmight require training complicated models from scratch, or are only applicable\\nfor born-digital PDF documents. In this section, we show how LayoutParser can\\nhelp build a light-weight accurate visual table extractor for legal docket tables\\nusing the existing resources with minimal eﬀort.\\nThe extractor uses a pre-trained layout detection model for identifying the\\ntable regions and some simple rules for pairing the rows and the columns in the\\nPDF image. Mask R-CNN [ 12] trained on the PubLayNet dataset [ 38] from the\\nLayoutParser Model Zoo can be used for detecting table regions. By ﬁltering\\nout model predictions of low conﬁdence and removing overlapping predictions,\\nLayoutParser can identify the tabular regions on each page, which signiﬁcantly\\nsimpliﬁes the subsequent steps. By applying the line detection functions within\\nthe tabular segments, provided in the utility module from LayoutParser, the\\npipeline can identify the three distinct columns in the tables. A row clustering\\nmethod is then applied via analyzing the y coordinates of token bounding boxes in\\nthe left-most column, which are obtained from the OCR engines. A non-maximal\\nsuppression algorithm is used to remove duplicated rows with extremely small\\ngaps. Shown in Figure 6, the built pipeline can detect tables at diﬀerent positions\\non a page accurately. Continued tables from diﬀerent pages are concatenated,\\nand a structured table representation has been easily created.\\n18 https://github.com/atlanhq/camelot, https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula'),\n",

Shen et al.\\n6 Conclusion\\nLayoutParser provides a comprehensive toolkit for deep learning-based document\\nimage analysis. The oﬀ-the-shelf library is easy to install, and can be used to\\nbuild ﬂexible and accurate pipelines for processing documents with complicated\\nstructures. It also supports high-level customization and enables easy labeling and\\ntraining of DL models on unique document image datasets. The LayoutParser\\ncommunity platform facilitates sharing DL models and DIA pipelines, inviting\\ndiscussion and promoting code reproducibility and reusability. TheLayoutParser\\nteam is committed to keeping the library updated continuously and bringing\\nthe most recent advances in DL-based DIA, such as multi-modal document\\nmodeling [37, 36, 9] (an upcoming priority), to a diverse audience of end-users.\\nAcknowledgements We thank the anonymous reviewers for their comments\\nand suggestions.

NIKE is\\nthe largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products through NIKE Direct operations, which are comprised of both NIKE-owned retail stores\\nand sales through our digital platforms (also referred to as \"NIKE Brand Digital\"), to retail accounts and to a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales\\nrepresentatives in nearly all countries around the world. We also offer interactive consumer services and experiences through our digital platforms. Nearly all of our\\nproducts are manufactured by independent contractors. Nearly all footwear and apparel products are manufactured outside the United States, while equipment products\\nare manufactured both in the United States and abroad.\\nAll references to fiscal 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are to NIKE, Inc.\\'s fiscal years ended May 31, 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Any references to other fiscal\\nyears refer to a fiscal year ending on May 31 of that year.\\nPRODUCTS\\nOur NIKE Brand product offerings are aligned around our consumer construct focused on Men\\'s, Women\\'s and Kids\\'. We also design products specifically for the Jordan\\nBrand and Converse. We believe this approach allows us to create products that better meet individual consumer needs while accelerating our largest growth\\nopportunities.\\nNIKE\\'s athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use, although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes. We\\nplace considerable emphasis on innovation and high-quality construction in the development and manufacturing of our products. Our Men\\'s, Women\\'s and Jordan Brand\\nfootwear products currently lead in footwear sales and we expect them to continue to do so.\\nWe also sell sports apparel, which features the same trademarks and are sold predominantly through the same marketing and distribution channels as athletic footwear.\\nOur sports apparel, similar to our athletic footwear products, is designed primarily for athletic use, although many of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes,\\nand demonstrates our commitment to innovation and high-quality construction. Our Men\\'s and Women\\'s apparel products currently lead in apparel sales and we expect\\nthem to continue to do so. We often market footwear, apparel and accessories in \"collections\" of similar use or by category. We also market apparel with licensed college\\nand professional team and league logos.\\nWe sell a line of performance equipment and accessories under the NIKE Brand name, including bags, socks, sport balls, eyewear, timepieces, digital devices, bats,\\ngloves, protective equipment and other equipment designed for sports activities. We also sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through\\nour wholly-owned subsidiary, NIKE IHM, Inc., doing business as Air Manufacturing Innovation.\\nOur Jordan Brand designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories predominantly focused on basketball performance and culture\\nusing the Jumpman trademark. Sales and operating results for Jordan Brand products are reported within the respective NIKE Brand geographic operating segments.\\nOur wholly-owned subsidiary brand, Converse, headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, designs, distributes and licenses casual sneakers, apparel and accessories\\nunder the Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell trademarks. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alone\\nbasis.\\nIn addition to the products we sell to our wholesale customers and directly to consumers through our NIKE Direct operations, we have also entered into license\\nagreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture and sell, using NIKE-owned trademarks, certain apparel, digital devices and applications and other equipment\\ndesigned for sports activities.\\n2023 FORM 10-K 1'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\..\\\\00-example_data\\\\pdf_dir\\\\nke-10k-2023.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='Table of Contents\\nWe also offer interactive consumer services and experiences as well as digital products through our digital platforms, including fitness and activity apps; sport, fitness and\\nwellness content; and digital services and features in retail stores that enhance the consumer experience.\\nSALES AND MARKETING\\nWe experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those\\nin the second and third fiscal quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular\\ntypes of footwear, apparel and equipment, as well as other macroeconomic, strategic, operating and logistics-related factors.\\nBecause NIKE is a consumer products company, the relative popularity and availability of various sports and fitness activities, as well as changing design trends, affect\\nthe demand for our products. We must, therefore, respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new\\nproducts, styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing. Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could\\nhave a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. This is a continuing risk. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.\\nOUR MARKETS\\nWe report our NIKE Brand operations based on our internal geographic organization. Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the\\ndesign, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. The Company\\'s reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North\\nAmerica; Europe, Middle East & Africa (\"EMEA\"); Greater China; and Asia Pacific & Latin America (\"APLA\"), and include results for the NIKE and Jordan brands. Sales\\nthrough our NIKE Direct operations are managed within each geographic operating segment.\\nConverse is also a reportable operating segment and operates predominately in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and\\naccessories. Converse direct to consumer operations, including digital commerce, are reported within the Converse operating segment results.\\nUNITED STATES MARKET\\nFor fiscal 2023, NIKE Brand and Converse sales in the United States accounted for approximately 43% of total revenues, compared to 40% and 39% for fiscal 2022 and\\nfiscal 2021, respectively. We sell our products to thousands of retail accounts in the United States, including a mix of footwear stores, sporting goods stores, athletic\\nspecialty stores, department stores, skate, tennis and golf shops and other retail accounts. In the United States, we utilize NIKE sales offices to solicit such sales. During\\nfiscal 2023, our three largest United States customers accounted for approximately 22% of sales in the United States.\\nOur NIKE Direct and Converse direct to consumer operations sell our products to consumers through various digital platforms.

The proliferation of Nike Air, Zoom, Free, Dri-FIT, Flyknit, FlyEase, ZoomX, Air Max, React and\\nForward technologies, among others, typifies our dedication to designing innovative products.\\nMANUFACTURING\\nNearly all of our footwear and apparel products are manufactured outside the United States by independent manufacturers (\"contract manufacturers\"), many of which\\noperate multiple factories. We are also supplied, primarily indirectly, by a number of materials, or \"Tier 2\" suppliers, who provide the principal materials used in footwear\\nand apparel finished goods products. As of May 31, 2023, we had 146 strategic Tier 2 suppliers.\\nAs of May 31, 2023, our contract manufacturers operated 123 finished goods footwear factories located in 11 countries.

For fiscal 2023, one apparel contract manufacturer accounted for more than 10% of apparel production, and the top five contract\\nmanufacturers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 52% of NIKE Brand apparel production.\\nNIKE\\'s contract manufacturers buy raw materials for the manufacturing of our footwear, apparel and equipment products. Most raw materials are available and purchased\\nby those contract manufacturers in the countries where manufacturing takes place.\\nThe principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, nylon,\\npolyester and natural fiber textiles, as well as polyurethane films used to make NIKE Air-Sole cushioning components. During fiscal 2023, Air Manufacturing Innovation, a\\nwholly-owned subsidiary, with facilities near Beaverton, Oregon, in Dong Nai Province, Vietnam, and St. Charles, Missouri, as well as contract manufacturers in China and\\nVietnam, were our suppliers of NIKE Air-Sole cushioning components used in footwear.\\nThe principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics, yarns and threads (both virgin and recycled); specialized performance fabrics\\ndesigned to efficiently wick moisture away from the body, retain heat and repel rain and/or snow; and plastic and metal hardware.\\nIn fiscal 2023, we experienced ongoing supply chain volatility during the first part of the year, which improved gradually during the course of the year. We also experienced\\nhigher supply chain network costs primarily due to inflationary pressures during the year. Despite competition for certain materials during fiscal 2023, contract\\nmanufacturers were able to source sufficient quantities of raw materials for use in our footwear and apparel products. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors, for additional\\ndiscussion of the impact of sourcing risks on our business.\\nSince 1972, Sojitz Corporation of America (\"Sojitz America\"), a large Japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock, has performed\\nimport-export financing services for us.\\nINTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TRADE\\nOur international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad, such as the implementation of, or potential changes in, foreign\\nand domestic trade policies, increases in import duties, anti-dumping measures, quotas, safeguard measures, trade restrictions, restrictions on the transfer of funds and,\\nin certain parts of the world, political tensions, instability, conflicts, nationalism and terrorism, and resulting sanctions and other measures imposed in response to such\\nissues. We have not, to date, been materially affected by any such risk but cannot predict the likelihood of such material effects occurring in the future.\\nIn recent years, uncertain global and regional economic and political conditions have affected international trade and increased protectionist actions around the\\nworld. These trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors, and the footwear and apparel industries, as a whole, are not immune. Companies in our\\nindustry are facing trade protectionism in many different regions, and, in nearly all cases, we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce\\nthe impact to the industry, while observing applicable competition laws. Notwithstanding our efforts, protectionist measures have resulted in increases in the cost of our\\nproducts, and additional measures, if implemented, could adversely affect sales and/or profitability for NIKE, as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a\\nwhole.\\nWe monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry, and we engage in administrative and judicial processes to\\nmitigate trade restrictions. We are actively monitoring actions that may result in additional anti-dumping measures and could affect our industry. We are also monitoring for\\nand advocating against other impediments that may limit or delay customs clearance for imports of footwear, apparel and equipment. NIKE also advocates for trade\\nliberalization for footwear and apparel in a number of bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements. Changes in, and responses to, U.S. trade policies, including the\\nimposition of tariffs or penalties on imported goods or retaliatory measures by other countries, have negatively affected, and could in the future negatively affect, U.S.\\ncorporations, including NIKE, with business operations and/or consumer markets in those countries, which could also make it necessary for us to change the way we\\nconduct business, either of which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or our results of operations. In addition, with respect to proposed trade\\nrestrictions, we work with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted\\nand implemented (i) addresses legitimate and core concerns, (ii) is consistent with international trade rules and (iii) reflects and considers domestic economies and the\\nimportant role they may play in the global economic community.\\nWhere trade protection measures are implemented, we believe we have the ability to develop, over a period of time, adequate alternative sources of supply for the\\nproducts obtained from our present suppliers. If events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country, our operations could be temporarily\\ndisrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact. However, we believe we could abate any such disruption, and that much of the adverse impact on supply\\nwould, therefore, be of a short-term nature, although alternate sources of supply might not be as cost-effective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability.\\n2023 FORM 10-K 4'),\n",

If global economic and financial market conditions deteriorate, the following factors, among others, could have a material adverse effect on our\\nbusiness, operating results and financial condition:\\n• Our sales are impacted by discretionary spending by consumers. Declines in consumer spending have in the past resulted in and may in the future result in reduced\\ndemand for our products, increased inventories, reduced orders from retailers for our products, order cancellations, lower revenues, higher discounts and lower gross\\nmargins.\\n• In the future, we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find it desirable to do so.\\n• We conduct transactions in various currencies, which creates exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. Continued\\nvolatility in the markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies has had and could continue to have a significant impact on our\\nreported operating results and financial condition.\\n• Continued volatility in the availability and prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products and in our supply chain (such as cotton or petroleum\\nderivatives) has had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our costs, gross margins and profitability. In addition, supply chain issues caused by\\nfactors including the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical conflicts have impacted and may continue to impact the availability, pricing and timing for obtaining\\ncommodities and raw materials.\\n• If retailers of our products experience declining revenues or experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products, this\\ncould result in reduced orders for our products, order cancellations, late retailer payments, extended payment terms, higher accounts receivable, reduced cash flows,\\ngreater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense.\\n• In the past, certain retailers of our products have experienced severe financial difficulty, become insolvent and ceased business operations, and this could occur in\\nthe future, which could negatively impact the sale of our products to consumers.\\n• If contract manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to\\npurchase raw materials or to finance capital equipment and other general working capital needs, it may result in delays or non-delivery of shipments of our products.\\nOur products, services and experiences face intense competition.\\nNIKE is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products,\\nservices and experiences. The athletic footwear, apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive both in the United States and worldwide. We compete\\ninternationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies, private labels\\nand large companies that have diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear, apparel and equipment. We also compete with other companies for the production\\ncapacity of contract manufacturers that produce our products. In addition, we and our contract manufacturers compete with other companies and industries for raw\\nmaterials used in our products. Our NIKE Direct operations, both through our digital commerce operations and retail stores, also compete with multi-brand retailers, which\\nsell our products through their digital platforms and physical stores, and with digital commerce platforms. In addition, we compete with respect to the digital services and\\nexperiences we are able to offer our consumers, including fitness and activity apps; sport, fitness and wellness content and services; and digital services and features in\\nretail stores that enhance the consumer experience.\\nProduct offerings, technologies, marketing expenditures (including expenditures for advertising and endorsements), pricing, costs of production, customer service, digital\\ncommerce platforms, digital services and experiences and social media presence are areas of intense competition. These, in addition to ongoing rapid changes in\\ntechnology, a reduction in barriers to the creation of new footwear and apparel companies and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear,\\napparel, and equipment, services and experiences, constitute significant risk factors in our operations. In addition, the competitive nature of retail, including shifts in the\\nways in which consumers shop, and the continued proliferation of digital commerce, constitutes a risk factor implicating our NIKE Direct and wholesale operations. If we\\ndo not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors, our costs may increase, demand for our products may decline, possibly significantly, or we may\\nneed to reduce wholesale or suggested retail prices for our products.\\n2023 FORM 10-K 10'),\n",

Central banks may deploy various\\nstrategies to combat inflation, including increasing interest rates, which may impact our borrowing costs. Additionally, there has been, and may continue to be, volatility in\\ncurrency exchange rates that impact the U.S. Dollar value relative to other international currencies. Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from\\nsales and operations in foreign currencies, and these revenues and expenses are affected by currency fluctuations, specifically amounts recorded in foreign currencies\\nand translated into U.S. Dollars for consolidated financial reporting, as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar adversely affects the U.S. Dollar value of\\nthe Company's foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers\\nthat produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. Foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected\\nand could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\\nWe hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay, but not to completely eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results.\\nSince the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility, they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. Dollar or other trading currency, but they also\\nreduce the positive impact of a weaker U.S. Dollar or other trading currency. Our future financial results have in the past been and could in the future be significantly\\naffected by the value of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any\\ngiven time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities.\\nWe may be adversely affected by the financial health of our wholesale customers.\\nWe extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer's financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. To assist in the scheduling of\\nproduction and the shipping of our products, we offer certain customers the opportunity to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering\\nprogram. These advance orders may be canceled under certain conditions, and the risk of cancellation increases when dealing with financially unstable retailers or\\nretailers struggling with economic uncertainty. In the past, some customers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies, which have had an\\nadverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition. When the retail economy weakens or as consumer behavior shifts, retailers\\ntend to be more cautious with orders. A slowing or changing economy in our key markets, including a recession, could adversely affect the financial health of our\\ncustomers, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, product sales are dependent in part on high quality\\nmerchandising and an appealing retail environment to attract consumers, which requires continuing investments by retailers. Retailers that experience financial difficulties\\nmay fail to make such investments or delay them, resulting in lower sales and orders for our products.\\nClimate change and other sustainability-related matters, or legal, regulatory or market responses thereto, may have an adverse impact on our business and\\nresults of operations.\\nThere are concerns that increased levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have caused, and may continue to cause, potentially at a\\ngrowing rate, increases in global temperatures, changes in weather patterns and increasingly frequent and/or prolonged extreme weather and climate events. Climate\\nchange may also exacerbate challenges relating to the availability and quality of water and raw materials, including those used in the production of our products, and may\\nresult in changes in regulations or consumer preferences, which could in turn affect our business, operating results and financial condition. For example, there has been\\nincreased focus by governmental and non-governmental organizations, consumers, customers, employees and other stakeholders on products that are sustainably made\\nand other sustainability matters, including responsible sourcing and deforestation, the use of plastic, energy and water, the recyclability or recoverability of packaging and\\nmaterials transparency, any of which may require us to incur increased costs for additional transparency, due diligence and reporting. In addition, federal, state or local\\ngovernmental authorities in various countries have proposed, and are likely to continue to propose, legislative and regulatory initiatives to reduce or mitigate the impacts of\\nclimate change on the environment. Various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of climate change, which could increase the\\ncomplexity of, and potential cost related to complying with, such regulations. Any of the foregoing may require us to make additional investments in facilities and\\nequipment, may impact the availability and cost of key raw materials used in the production of our products or the demand for our products, and, in turn, may adversely\\nimpact our business, operating results and financial condition.\\nAlthough we have announced sustainability-related goals and targets, there can be no assurance that our stakeholders will agree with our strategies, and any perception,\\nwhether or not valid, that we have failed to achieve, or to act responsibly with respect to, such matters or to effectively respond to new or additional legal or regulatory\\nrequirements regarding climate change, could result in adverse publicity and adversely affect our business and reputation. Execution of these strategies and achievement\\nof our goals is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not\\n2023 FORM 10-K 11\"),\n",

As a result, there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute our strategies and achieve our sustainability-related goals, which\\ncould damage our reputation and customer and other stakeholder relationships and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\\nExtreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\\nGiven the broad and global scope of our operations, we are particularly vulnerable to the physical risks of climate change, such as shifts in weather patterns. Extreme\\nweather conditions in the areas in which our retail stores, suppliers, manufacturers, customers, distribution centers, offices, headquarters and vendors are located could\\nadversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Moreover, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires, tsunamis, floods or droughts,\\nwhether occurring in the United States or abroad, and their related consequences and effects, including energy shortages and public health issues, have in the past\\ntemporarily disrupted, and could in the future disrupt, our operations, the operations of our vendors, manufacturers and other suppliers or have in the past resulted in, and\\nin the future could result in, economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. In particular, if a natural disaster or severe\\nweather event were to occur in an area in which we or our suppliers, manufacturers, employees, customers, distribution centers or vendors are located, our continued\\nsuccess would depend, in part, on the safety and availability of the relevant personnel and facilities and proper functioning of our or third parties\\' computer, network,\\ntelecommunication and other systems and operations. In addition, a natural disaster or severe weather event could negatively impact retail traffic to our stores or stores\\nthat carry our products and could have an adverse impact on consumer spending, any of which could in turn result in negative point-of-sale trends for our merchandise.\\nFurther, climate change may increase both the frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions and natural disasters, which may affect our business operations,\\neither in a particular region or globally, as well as the activities of our third-party vendors and other suppliers, manufacturers and customers. We believe the diversity of\\nlocations in which we operate, our operational size, disaster recovery and business continuity planning and our information technology systems and networks, including\\nthe Internet and third-party services (\"Information Technology Systems\"), position us well, but may not be sufficient for all or for concurrent eventualities. If we were to\\nexperience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event or concurrent events, we could experience operational challenges, in particular depending upon\\nhow a local or regional event may affect our human capital across our operations or with regard to particular aspects of our operations, such as key executive officers or\\npersonnel. For example, our world headquarters is located in an active seismic zone, which is at a higher risk for earthquakes and the related consequences or effects.\\nFurther, if we are unable to find alternative suppliers, replace capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations or quickly repair damage to our Information\\nTechnology Systems or supply systems, we could be late in delivering, or be unable to deliver, products to our customers. These events could result in reputational\\ndamage, lost sales, cancellation charges or markdowns, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\\nOur financial condition and results of operations have been, and could in the future be, adversely affected by a pandemic, epidemic or other public healthemergency.\\nPandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and other public health emergencies, and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate such crises have caused,\\nand may in the future cause, business slowdown or shutdown in affected areas and significant disruption in the financial markets, both globally and in the United States.\\nThese events have led to and could again lead to adverse impacts to our global supply chain, factory cancellation costs, store closures, and a decline in retail traffic and\\ndiscretionary spending by consumers and, in turn, materially impact our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations as well as cause a volatile effective\\ntax rate driven by changes in the mix of earnings across our jurisdictions. We cannot predict whether, and to what degree, our sales, operations and financial results could\\nin the future be affected by the pandemic and preventative measures. Risks presented by pandemics and other public health emergencies include, but are not limited to:\\n• Deterioration in economic conditions in the United States and globally, including the effect of prolonged periods of inflation on our consumers and vendors;\\n• Disruption to our distribution centers, contract manufacturers, finished goods factories and other vendors, through the effects of facility closures, increased operating\\ncosts, reductions in operating hours, labor shortages, and real time changes in operating procedures, such as additional cleaning and disinfection procedures, which\\nhave had, and could in the future again have, a significant impact on our planned inventory production and distribution, including higher inventory levels or inventory\\nshortages in various markets;\\n2023 FORM 10-K 12'),\n",

These supply\\nchain effects have had, and could in the future have, an adverse effect on our ability to meet consumer demand, including digital demand, and have in the past\\nresulted in and could in the future result in extended inventory transit times and an increase in our costs of production and distribution, including increased freight and\\nlogistics costs and other expenses;\\n• Decreased retail traffic as a result of store closures, reduced operating hours, social distancing restrictions and/or changes in consumer behavior;\\n• Reduced consumer demand for our products, including as a result of a rise in unemployment rates, higher costs of borrowing, inflation and diminished consumer\\nconfidence;\\n• Cancellation or postponement of sports seasons and sporting events in multiple countries, and bans on large public gatherings, which have reduced and in the future\\ncould reduce consumer spending on our products and could impact the effectiveness of our arrangements with key endorsers;\\n• The risk that any safety protocols in NIKE-owned or affiliated facilities, including our offices, will not be effective or not be perceived as effective, or that any virus-\\nrelated illnesses will be linked or alleged to be linked to such facilities, whether accurate or not;\\n• Incremental costs resulting from the adoption of preventative measures and compliance with regulatory requirements, including providing facial coverings and hand\\nsanitizer, rearranging operations to follow social distancing protocols, conducting temperature checks, testing and undertaking regular and thorough disinfecting of\\nsurfaces;\\n• Bankruptcies or other financial difficulties facing our wholesale customers, which could cause them to be unable to make or delay making payments to us, or result in\\nrevised payment terms, cancellation or reduction of their orders; and\\n• Significant disruption of and volatility in global financial markets, which could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital in the future.\\nWe cannot reasonably predict the ultimate impact of any pandemic or public health emergency, including the extent of any adverse impact on our business, results of\\noperations and financial condition, which will depend on, among other things, the duration and spread of the pandemic or public health emergency, the impact of\\ngovernmental regulations that have been, and may continue to be, imposed in response, the effectiveness of actions taken to contain or mitigate the outbreak, the\\navailability, safety and efficacy of vaccines, including against emerging variants of the infectious disease, and global economic conditions. Additionally, disruptions have in\\nthe past made it more challenging to compare our performance, including our revenue growth and overall profitability, across quarters and fiscal years, and could have\\nthis effect in the future. Any pandemic or public health emergency may also affect our business, results of operations or financial condition in a manner that is not\\npresently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks and may also exacerbate, or occur concurrently with, other risks discussed in this\\nItem 1A. Risk Factors, any of which could have a material effect on us.\\nBusiness and Operational Risks\\nFailure to maintain our reputation, brand image and culture could negatively impact our business.\\nOur iconic brands have worldwide recognition, and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation. Maintaining, promoting\\nand growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts, including advertising and consumer campaigns, product innovation and product quality. Our\\ncommitment to product innovation, quality and sustainability, and our continuing investment in design (including materials), marketing and sustainability measures may not\\nhave the desired impact on our brand image and reputation. In addition, our success in maintaining, extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to\\nadapt to a rapidly changing media and digital environment, including our reliance on social media and other digital advertising networks, and digital dissemination of\\nadvertising campaigns on our digital platforms and through our digital experiences and products. We could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these\\nobjectives.\\nOur brand value also depends on our ability to maintain a positive consumer perception of our corporate integrity, purpose and brand culture. Negative claims or publicity\\ninvolving us, our culture and values, our products, services and experiences, consumer data, or any of our key employees, endorsers, sponsors, suppliers or partners\\ncould seriously damage our reputation and brand image, regardless of whether such claims are accurate. For example, while we require our suppliers of our products to\\noperate their business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we do not control their practices. Negative publicity relating to a violation or an alleged violation\\nof policies or laws by such suppliers could damage our brand image and diminish consumer trust in our brand. Further, our reputation and brand image could be damaged\\nas a result of our support of, association with or lack of support or disapproval of certain social causes, as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct, or\\nchange, certain of our activities in response to such considerations. Social media, which accelerates and potentially amplifies the scope of negative publicity, can increase\\nthe challenges of responding to negative claims. Adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us, or by us, could also damage our reputation and brand\\nimage, undermine consumer confidence in us and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our\\noperations.

Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those\\nin the second and third fiscal quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time or in the future as a result of strategic shifts in our\\nbusiness and seasonal or geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment and in connection with the timing of significant sporting events, such\\nas the NBA Finals, Olympics or the World Cup, among others. In addition, our customers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products\\nordered with minimal notice. As a result, we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales. Accordingly, our results of operations are likely to fluctuate\\nsignificantly from period to period. This seasonality, along with other factors that are beyond our control, including economic conditions, changes in consumer preferences,\\nweather conditions, outbreaks of disease, social or political unrest, availability of import quotas, transportation disruptions and currency exchange rate fluctuations, has in\\nthe past adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate. Our operating margins are also sensitive\\nto a number of additional factors that are beyond our control, including manufacturing and transportation costs, shifts in product sales mix and geographic sales trends, all\\nof which we expect to continue. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period.\\nIf we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues and profits.\\nOur success depends on our ability to identify, originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely\\nmanner. However, lead times for many of our products may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or consumer preferences. All\\nof our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. Our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as\\nconsumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success depends in\\npart on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. If we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the\\nmix of existing product offerings, developing new products, designs, styles and categories, and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing, we\\ncould experience lower sales, excess inventories or lower profit margins, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In\\naddition, we market our products globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns, including social media and other digital\\nadvertising networks. If we do not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase, these factors could have an adverse effect on our\\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe rely on technical innovation and high-quality products to compete in the market for our products.\\nTechnical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing processes of footwear, apparel, equipment and other products and services are essential to the\\ncommercial success of our products and development of new products. Research and development play a key role in technical innovation. We rely upon specialists in the\\nfields of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, digital technologies, industrial design, sustainability and related fields, as well as research committees\\nand advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists and other experts to develop and test cutting-edge\\nperformance products. While we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance and reduce injury and maximize comfort, if we fail to introduce\\ntechnical innovation in our products, consumer demand for our products could decline, and if we experience problems with the quality of our products, we may incur\\nsubstantial expense to remedy the problems and loss of consumer confidence.\\nFailure to continue to obtain or maintain high-quality endorsers of our products could harm our business.\\nWe establish relationships with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues, as well as other public figures, including artists, designers and influencers, to develop,\\nevaluate and promote our products, as well as establish product authenticity with consumers. However, as competition in our industry has increased, the costs associated\\nwith establishing and retaining such sponsorships and other relationships have increased, and competition to attract and retain high-quality endorsers has increased. If we\\nare unable to maintain our current associations with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues, or other public figures, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could\\nlose the high visibility or on-field authenticity associated with our products, and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. As a\\nresult, our brands, net revenues, expenses and profitability could be harmed.\\nFurthermore, if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, actions\\ntaken or statements made by athletes, teams or leagues, or other endorsers, associated with our products or brand that harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or\\nleagues, or endorsers, or our decisions to cease collaborating with certain endorsers in light of actions taken or statements made by them, have in the past harmed and\\ncould in the future seriously harm our brand image with consumers and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on\\n2023 FORM 10-K 14'),\n",

Poor or non-performance by our endorsers, a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes, public figures or sports\\norganizations, to use and endorse our products and brand or a failure to enter into cost-effective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes, public figures and\\nsports organizations could adversely affect our brand, sales and profitability.\\nFailure to accurately forecast consumer demand could lead to excess inventories or inventory shortages, which could result in decreased operating margins,reduced cash flows and harm to our business.\\nTo meet anticipated demand for our products, we purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders,\\nwhich we hold in inventory and resell to customers. There is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers. Inventory levels in excess of\\ncustomer demand may result in inventory write-downs, and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an\\nadverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail\\nto supply products we require at the time we need them, we may experience inventory shortages. Inventory shortages could delay shipments to customers, negatively\\nimpact retailer, distributor and consumer relationships and diminish brand loyalty. The difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of\\noperations, financial condition and cash flows from period to period. A failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net\\nrevenues and net income, and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance.\\nOur NIKE Direct operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerousrisks and uncertainties.\\nOur NIKE Direct operations, including our retail stores and digital platforms, have required and will continue to require significant investment. Our NIKE Direct stores have\\nrequired and will continue to require substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements and personnel. We have entered into substantial operating\\nlease commitments for retail space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and marketing activities and\\nto integrate with our digital platforms. Because of their unique design and technological elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment\\nthan other stores. Due to the high fixed-cost structure associated with our NIKE Direct retail stores, a decline in sales, a shift in consumer behavior away from brick-and-\\nmortar retail, or the closure, temporary or otherwise, or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of\\nequipment and leasehold improvements and employee-related costs.\\nMany factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond our control, pose risks and uncertainties. Risks include, but are not limited to: credit card fraud;\\nmismanagement of existing retail channel partners; inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation; and theft.\\nIn addition, we have made significant investments in digital technologies and information systems for the digital aspect of our NIKE Direct operations, and our digital\\nofferings will require continued investment in the development and upgrading of our technology platforms. In order to deliver high-quality digital experiences, our digital\\nplatforms must be designed effectively and work well with a range of other technologies, systems, networks, and standards that we do not control. We may not be\\nsuccessful in developing platforms that operate effectively with these technologies, systems, networks or standards. A growing portion of consumers access our NIKE\\nDirect digital platforms, but in the event that it is more difficult for consumers to access and use our digital platforms, consumers find that our digital platforms do not\\neffectively meet their needs or expectations or consumers choose not to access or use our digital platforms or use devices that do not offer access to our platforms, the\\nsuccess of our NIKE Direct operations could be adversely impacted. Our competitors may develop, or have already developed, digital experiences, features, content,\\nservices or technologies that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance. \\nWe may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment in our NIKE Direct operations and management's attention from our other business opportunities could be\\ndiverted, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\\nIf the technology-based systems that give our consumers the ability to shop or interact with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, aswell as our ability to grow our digital commerce business globally or to retain our customer base, could be materially adversely affected.\\nMany of our consumers shop with us through our digital platforms. Increasingly, consumers are using mobile-based devices and applications to shop online with us and\\nwith our competitors, and to do comparison shopping, as well as to engage with us and our competitors through digital services and experiences that are offered on\\nmobile platforms. We use social media and proprietary mobile applications to interact with our consumers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. Any\\nfailure on our part to provide attractive, effective, reliable, secure and user-friendly digital commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise with rapid\\ndelivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers or any failure to provide attractive digital experiences to our customers could\\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of digital commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with consumers, have a material adverse impact on the\\ngrowth of our digital commerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.

If we\\nfail to continue to effectively scale and adapt our digital platforms to accommodate increased consumer demand, our business may be subject to interruptions, delays or\\nfailures and consumer demand for our products and digital experiences could decline.\\nRisks specific to our digital commerce business also include diversion of sales from our and our retailers' brick and mortar stores, difficulty in recreating the in-store\\nexperience through direct channels and liability for online content. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our digital commerce\\nbusiness, as well as damage our reputation and brands.\\nWe rely significantly on information technology to operate our business, including our supply chain and retail operations, and any failure, inadequacy orinterruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business.\\nWe are heavily dependent on Information Technology Systems, across our supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing,\\ntransportation, sales and distribution, as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes, retail operations and other business\\nactivities. Information Technology Systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service\\ninterruption or shutdown. For example, our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends\\nsignificantly on the reliability of these Information Technology Systems. Over a number of years, we have implemented Information Technology Systems in all of the\\ngeographical regions in which we operate. Our work to integrate, secure and enhance these systems and related processes in our global operations is ongoing and NIKE\\nwill continue to invest in these efforts. We cannot provide assurance, however, that the measures we take to secure and enhance these systems will be sufficient to\\nprotect our Information Technology Systems and prevent cyber-attacks, system failures or data or information loss. The failure of these systems to operate effectively,\\nincluding as a result of security breaches, viruses, hackers, malware, natural disasters, vendor business interruptions or other causes, failure to properly maintain, protect,\\nrepair or upgrade systems, or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our\\noperations, could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem which may not be sufficient to cover all eventualities, and may have an adverse effect on\\nour reputation, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the use of employee-owned devices for communications as well as hybrid work arrangements,\\npresent additional operational risks to our Information Technology Systems, including, but not limited to, increased risks of cyber-attacks. Further, like other companies in\\nthe retail industry, we have in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, cyber-attacks, including phishing, and other attempts to breach, or gain\\nunauthorized access to, our systems. To date, these attacks have not had a material impact on our operations, but we cannot provide assurance that they will not have an\\nimpact in the future.\\nWe also use Information Technology Systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory\\nfinancial reporting, legal and tax requirements. From time to time, we have expended, and expect to continue to expend, significant resources to modify, update and\\nenhance our Information Technology Systems and to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures. These modifications, updates and enhancements may\\ncost more than initially expected and may not be effective in preventing issues and disruptions. Moreover, due to the complexity of our Information Technology Systems,\\nthe process of implementing modifications or enhancements can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues. If Information Technology Systems suffer\\nsevere damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans, or those of our vendors, do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could\\nexperience delays in reporting our financial results, which could result in lost revenues and profits, as well as reputational damage. Furthermore, we depend on\\nInformation Technology Systems and personal data collection for digital marketing, digital commerce, consumer engagement and the marketing and use of our digital\\nproducts and services. We also rely on our ability to engage in electronic communications throughout the world between and among our employees as well as with other\\nthird parties, including customers, suppliers, vendors and consumers. Any interruption in Information Technology Systems may impede our ability to engage in the digital\\nspace and result in lost revenues, damage to our reputation, and loss of users.\\nWe are subject to the risk our licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of our brands.\\nWe currently license, and expect to continue licensing, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. If our licensees fail to\\nsuccessfully market and sell licensed products, or fail to obtain sufficient capital or effectively manage their business operations, customer relationships, labor\\nrelationships, supplier relationships or credit risks, it could adversely affect our revenues, both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of\\nour other products.\\nWe also rely on our licensees to help preserve the value of our brands. Although we attempt to protect our brands through approval rights over the design, production\\nprocesses, quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our licensed products, we cannot completely control the use of our licensed\\nbrands by our licensees. The misuse of a brand by or negative publicity involving a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on us.\\n2023 FORM 10-K 16\"),\n",

The market shares of these retailers may increase through acquisitions and construction of additional stores and\\ninvestments in digital capacity, and as a result of attrition as struggling retailers exit the market. Consolidation of our retailers will concentrate our credit risk with a smaller\\nset of retailers, any of whom may experience declining sales or a shortage of liquidity. In addition, increasing market share concentration among a few retailers in a\\nparticular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products, we may be unable to find sufficient retail\\noutlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues.\\nIf one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses.\\nAs part of our hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, which may include forward contracts, commodity futures contracts,\\noption contracts, collars and swaps with various financial institutions. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and other investments on deposit\\nor in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the United States and abroad. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty\\nfinancial institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of\\nour counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default, or our assets deposited or held in accounts\\nwith such counterparty, may be limited by the counterparty's liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default or\\nfailure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\\nWe rely on a concentrated source base of contract manufacturers to supply a significant portion of our footwear products.\\nAs of May 31, 2023, our contract manufacturers operated 123 finished goods footwear factories located in 11 countries. We rely upon contract manufacturers, which we\\ndo not own or operate, to manufacture all of the footwear products we sell. For fiscal 2023, four footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10% of\\nfootwear production and in the aggregate accounted for approximately 58% of NIKE Brand footwear production. Our ability to meet our customers' needs depends on our\\nability to maintain a steady supply of products from our contract manufacturers. If one or more of our significant suppliers were to sever their relationship with us or\\nsignificantly alter the terms of our relationship, including due to changes in applicable trade policies, or be unable to perform, we may not be able to obtain replacement\\nproducts in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, sales, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, if any\\nof our primary footwear contract manufacturers fail to make timely shipments, do not meet our quality standards or otherwise fail to deliver us product in accordance with\\nour plans, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\\nCertain of our footwear contract manufacturers are highly specialized and only produce a specific type of product. Such contract manufacturers may go out of business if\\nconsumer preferences or market conditions change such that there is no longer sufficient demand for the types of products they produce. If, in the future, the relevant\\nproducts are again in demand and the specialized contract manufacturers no longer exist, we may not be able to locate replacement facilities to manufacture certain\\nfootwear products in a timely manner or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales, financial condition or results of operations.\\nThe market for prime real estate is competitive.\\nOur ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new retail stores and otherwise conduct our operations, both domestically and internationally, depends on the\\navailability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics and other factors. We also must be able to\\neffectively renew our existing real estate leases. In addition, from time to time, we seek to downsize, consolidate, reposition or close some of our real estate locations,\\nwhich may require modification of an existing lease. Failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify leases for existing locations, or failure to effectively\\nmanage the profitability of our existing fleet of retail stores, could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\\nAdditionally, the economic environment may make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties domestically and internationally. This could impact\\nthe quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality of\\nthese decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores,\\nwhich could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\\n2023 FORM 10-K 17\"),\n",

The loss of the services of key\\nindividuals, or any negative perception with respect to these individuals, or our workplace culture or values, could harm our business. Our success also depends on our\\nability to recruit, retain and engage our personnel sufficiently, both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives. Competition for employees in\\nour industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. Changes to our current and future work models may not meet the needs\\nor expectations of our employees or may not be perceived as favorable compared to other companies' policies, which could negatively impact our ability to attract, hire\\nand retain our employees. In addition, shifts in U.S. immigration policy could negatively impact our ability to attract, hire and retain highly skilled employees who are from\\noutside the United States. We also believe that our corporate culture has been a key driver of our success, and we have invested substantial time and resources in\\nbuilding, maintaining and evolving our culture. Any failure to preserve and evolve our culture could negatively affect our future success, including our ability to retain and\\nrecruit employees.\\nOur business operations and financial performance could be adversely affected by changes in our relationship with our workforce or changes to UnitedStates or foreign employment regulations.\\nWe have significant exposure to changes in domestic and foreign laws governing our relationships with our workforce, including wage and hour laws and regulations, fair\\nlabor standards, minimum wage requirements, overtime pay, unemployment tax rates, workers' compensation rates, citizenship requirements and payroll taxes, which\\ncould have a direct impact on our operating costs. A significant increase in minimum wage or overtime rates in countries where we have workforce could have a significant\\nimpact on our operating costs and may require that we relocate those operations or take other steps to mitigate such increases, all of which may cause us to incur\\nadditional costs. There is also a risk of potential claims that we have violated laws related to discrimination and harassment, health and safety, wage and hour laws,\\ncriminal activity, personal injury and other claims. In addition, if there were a significant increase in the number of members of our workforce who are members of labor\\norganizations or become parties to collective bargaining agreements, we could be vulnerable to a strike, work stoppage or other labor action, which could have an\\nadverse effect on our business.\\nRisks Related to Operating a Global Business\\nOur international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business.\\nNearly all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the United States, and the majority of our products are sold outside of the United States.\\nAccordingly, we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad, which include foreign laws and regulations, varying consumer\\npreferences across geographic regions, political tensions, unrest, disruptions or delays in cross-border shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in\\nwhich our products are manufactured or where we sell products. Changes in U.S. or international social, political, regulatory and economic conditions could impact our\\nbusiness, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, political and economic instability, geopolitical conflicts, political unrest, civil strife, terrorist\\nactivity, acts of war, public corruption, expropriation, nationalism and other economic or political uncertainties in the United States or internationally could interrupt and\\nnegatively affect the sale of our products or other business operations. Any negative sentiment toward the United States as a result of any such changes could also\\nadversely affect our business.\\nIn addition, disease outbreaks, terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad. These factors, among others, could affect our ability to\\nmanufacture products or procure materials, or our costs for manufacturing and procuring materials, our ability to import products, our ability to sell products in international\\nmarkets and our cost of doing business. If any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical, our business could\\nbe adversely affected.\\nOur products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing, manufacturing and financing.\\nThe principal materials used in our footwear products — natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, nylon,\\npolyester and natural fiber textiles and polyurethane films — are locally available to manufacturers. The principal materials used in our apparel products — natural and\\nsynthetic fabrics, yarns and threads (both virgin and recycled), specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body, retain heat and\\nrepel rain and/or snow as well as plastic and metal hardware — are also available in countries where our manufacturing takes place. Both our apparel and footwear\\nproducts are dependent upon the ability of our contract manufacturers to locate, train, employ and retain adequate personnel. NIKE contract manufacturers and materials\\nsuppliers buy raw materials and are subject to wage rates and other labor standards that are oftentimes regulated by the governments of the countries in which our\\nproducts are manufactured.\\nThere could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption or heightened competition for such\\nmaterials, our contract manufacturers might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all.

In addition, we cannot be certain that manufacturers that we do not contract and that we refer to as\\n\"unaffiliated manufacturers\" will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. If we experience significant increases in demand, or reductions in the availability of materials,\\nor need to replace an existing contract manufacturer or materials supplier, there can be no assurance additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional\\nmanufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or that any contract manufacturer, unaffiliated manufacturer, or any materials\\nsupplier would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing capacity or\\nsources of materials, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in our methods,\\nproducts, quality control standards and labor, health and safety standards. Any delays, interruption or increased costs in labor or wages, in the supply of materials or in the\\nmanufacturing of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and\\nnet income both in the short- and long-term.\\nBecause contract manufacturers make a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets, our products must be transported by third parties over large\\ngeographic distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, container shortages, labor shortages, including work\\nstoppages or port strikes, infrastructure and port congestion or other factors, and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers,\\nhave adversely impacted, and could in the future adversely impact the availability of our products and, in turn, our financial performance. In addition, delays in the\\nshipment or delivery of our products, manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products have required us, and may in the future require us to use faster, but\\nmore expensive, transportation methods such as air freight, which could adversely affect our profit margins. The cost of oil is a significant component in manufacturing and\\ntransportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins. Changes in U.S. trade policies, including modifications to\\nimport tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements, have also had, and could continue to have a significant impact on our activities in foreign jurisdictions, and could\\nadversely affect our reputation or results of operations.\\nOur success depends on our global distribution facilities.\\nWe distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world. Our ability to meet customer expectations,\\nmanage inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies and growth, particularly in emerging markets, depends on the proper operation of our\\ndistribution facilities, the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties (including those involved in\\nshipping product to and from our distribution facilities). Our distribution facilities have in the past and could in the future be interrupted by information technology problems,\\ndisasters such as earthquakes or fires or outbreaks of disease or government actions taken to mitigate their spread. Any significant failure in our distribution facilities could\\nresult in an adverse effect on our business. We maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects caused by significant\\ndisruptions in our distribution facilities.\\nLegal, Regulatory, and Compliance Risks\\nWe are subject to a complex array of laws and regulations and litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings, which could have an adverse effect onour business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nAs a multinational corporation with operations and distribution channels throughout the world, we are subject to and must comply with extensive laws and regulations in\\nthe United States and other jurisdictions in which we have operations and distribution channels. If we or our employees, agents, suppliers, and other partners fail to\\ncomply with any of these laws or regulations, such failure could subject us to fines, sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation, business,\\nfinancial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, laws, regulations and policies and the interpretation of such, can conflict among jurisdictions and compliance in\\none jurisdiction may result in legal or reputational risks in another jurisdiction. We are involved in various types of claims, lawsuits, regulatory proceedings and government\\ninvestigations relating to our business, our products and the actions of our employees and representatives, including contractual and employment relationships, product\\nliability, antitrust, trademark rights and a variety of other matters. It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of any such legal or regulatory proceedings or\\ninvestigations, and we could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties, or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on\\nour business, financial condition and results of operations and negatively impact our reputation. The global nature of our business means legal and compliance risks, such\\nas anti-bribery, anti-corruption, fraud, trade, environmental, competition, privacy and other regulatory matters, will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and\\nother contingencies have and will continue to arise from time to time, which could adversely affect us. In addition, the adoption of new laws or regulations, or changes in\\nthe interpretation of existing laws or regulations, may result in significant unanticipated legal and reputational risks. Moreover, the regulation of certain transactions we\\nengage in, including those involving virtual goods and cryptocurrencies, remains in an early stage and subject to significant uncertainty.

Any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings could divert\\nmanagement's attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees.\\nChanges to U.S. or other countries' trade policies and tariff and import/export regulations or our failure to comply with such regulations may have a materialadverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nChanges in the U.S. government's import and export policies, including trade restrictions, sanctions and countersanctions, increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes,\\nsafeguards or customs restrictions, could require us to change the way we conduct business and adversely affect our results of operations.\\nIn addition, changes in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories or countries where we currently sell our\\nproducts or conduct our business could adversely affect our business. U.S. presidential administrations have instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include\\nthe negotiation or termination of trade agreements, the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S., economic sanctions on individuals, corporations or countries,\\nand other government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we conduct our business. It may be time-consuming and expensive for us to\\nalter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes.\\nChanges or proposed changes in U.S. or other countries' trade policies may result in restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade. Tariffs and other\\nchanges in U.S. trade policy have in the past and could in the future trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governments have instituted or are\\nconsidering imposing retaliatory measures on certain U.S. goods. Further, any emerging protectionist or nationalist trends either in the United States or in other countries\\ncould affect the trade environment. The Company, similar to many other multinational corporations, does a significant amount of business that would be impacted by\\nchanges to the trade policies of the United States and foreign countries (including governmental action related to tariffs, international trade agreements, or economic\\nsanctions). Such changes have the potential to adversely impact the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof or the economy of another country in which we conduct\\noperations, our industry and the global demand for our products, and as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\\noperations.\\nIn addition, many of our imported products are subject to duties, tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the United States\\nand other countries. Any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate, adjust or impose new quotas, duties, tariffs, safeguard measures, anti-\\ndumping duties, cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism, restrictions on the transfer of currency, climate change legislation, product safety regulations or other charges or\\nrestrictions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\\nFurthermore, we are subject to the FCPA as well as the anti-corruption laws of other countries in which we operate. Although we implement policies and procedures\\ndesigned to promote compliance with these laws, our employees, independent contractors, contract manufacturers, suppliers and agents, as well as those companies to\\nwhich we outsource certain of our business operations, may take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation could result in sanctions or other penalties and\\nhave an adverse effect on our business, reputation and operating results.\\nFailure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.\\nWe periodically discover counterfeit reproductions of our products or products that otherwise infringe our intellectual property rights. If we are unsuccessful in enforcing\\nour intellectual property rights, continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and could result in a shift of consumer preference away\\nfrom our products.\\nThe actions we take to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others. We also may be unable to\\nprevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights.\\nWe may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. Defending infringement claims could be expensive and time-\\nconsuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development,\\nmanufacturing, use, importation and/or sale of certain products.\\nWe take various actions to prevent the unauthorized use and/or disclosure of our confidential information and intellectual property rights. These actions include contractual\\nmeasures such as entering into non-disclosure and non-compete agreements and agreements relating to our collaborations with third parties and providing confidential\\ninformation awareness training. Our controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use and/or disclosure of confidential information and intellectual property rights might not\\nalways be effective. For example, confidential information related to business strategy, innovations, new technologies, mergers and acquisitions, unpublished financial\\nresults or personal data could be prematurely, inadvertently, or improperly used and/or disclosed, resulting in a loss of reputation, loss of intellectual property rights, a\\ndecline in our stock price and/or a negative impact on our market position, and could lead to damages, fines, penalties or injunctions. In addition, new products we offer,\\nsuch as virtual goods, may raise various novel intellectual property law considerations, including adequacy and scope of assignment, licensing, transfer, copyright and\\nother right-of-use issues.\\n2023 FORM 10-K 20\"),\n",

We may\\nface significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights, including outside the United States, and if we are unable to\\nsuccessfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition may be adversely affected.\\nWe are subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect our results, operations or reputation.\\nIn addition to our own sensitive and proprietary business information, we handle transactional and personal information about our wholesale customers and consumers\\nand users of our digital experiences, which include online distribution channels and product engagement, adaptive products and personal fitness applications. Hackers\\nand data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate social engineering, such as phishing, and large-scale, complex automated attacks that can evade detection\\nfor long periods of time. Any breach of our or our service providers\\' networks, or other vendor systems, may result in the loss of confidential business and financial data,\\nmisappropriation of our consumers\\', users\\' or employees\\' personal information or a disruption of our business. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect\\non our business, including unwanted media attention, impairment of our consumer and customer relationships, damage to our reputation; resulting in lost sales and\\nconsumers, fines, lawsuits, or significant legal and remediation expenses. We also may need to expend significant resources to protect against, respond to and/or redress\\nproblems caused by any breach.\\nIn addition, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous, and sometimes conflicting, regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the\\nUnited States, Europe and elsewhere. For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (the \"GDPR\"); the United Kingdom enacted the\\nUK General Data Protection Regulation (which implements the GDPR into UK law); several states in the United States have passed data privacy laws; China enacted the\\nData Security Law and Personal Information Protection Law; and additional jurisdictions have adopted or are considering proposing or adopting similar regulations. These\\nlaws impose additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provide certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored.\\nCompliance with existing, proposed and recently enacted laws and regulations can be costly and time consuming, and any failure to comply with these regulatory\\nstandards could subject us to legal, operational and reputational risks. Misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws\\nand regulations, proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others, imposition of fines by governmental authorities and damage to our reputation and\\ncredibility and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits.\\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax laws, additional tax liabilities or increased volatility in our effective tax rate.\\nWe earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and, as such, we are subject to the tax laws in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.\\nCurrent economic and political conditions make tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, in any jurisdiction subject to significant change.\\nProposals to reform U.S. and foreign tax laws could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on global earnings and could increase the U.S.\\ncorporate tax rate. For example, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit\\nShifting (the \"Inclusive Framework\") has put forth two proposals—Pillar One and Pillar Two—that revise the existing profit allocation and nexus rules and ensure a minimal\\nlevel of taxation, respectively. On December 12, 2022, the European Union member states agreed to implement the Inclusive Framework\\'s global corporate minimum tax\\nrate of 15%. Other countries are also actively considering changes to their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the Inclusive Framework\\'s proposals. Although we cannot\\npredict whether or in what form these proposals will be enacted into law, these changes, if enacted into law, could have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate,\\nincome tax expense and cash flows.\\nPortions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are under a tax holiday. We also utilize tax rulings and other agreements to obtain certainty in treatment of\\ncertain tax matters. Tax holidays and rulings can expire from time to time and may be extended when certain conditions are met, or terminated if certain conditions are not\\nmet. The impact of any changes in conditions would be the loss of certainty in treatment thus potentially impacting our effective income tax rate. For example, in January\\n2019, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether the Netherlands has breached State Aid rules when granting certain tax rulings to the\\nCompany. If this matter is adversely resolved, the Netherlands may be required to assess additional amounts with respect to prior periods, and the Company\\'s income\\ntaxes related to prior periods in the Netherlands could increase.\\nWe are also subject to the examination of our tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the\\nlikelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax provisions\\nare adequate, the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results\\nof audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made. For\\nexample, we and our subsidiaries are also engaged in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions.

Negative publicity regarding production\\nmethods, alleged unethical or illegal practices or workplace or related conditions of any of our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our brand\\nimage and sales, force us to locate alternative suppliers, manufacturers or licenses or result in the imposition of additional regulations, including new or additional quotas,\\ntariffs, sanctions, product safety regulations or other regulatory measures, by governmental authorities.\\nRisks Related to Our Securities, Investments and Liquidity\\nOur financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns.\\nFrom time to time, we may invest in technology, business infrastructure, new businesses or capabilities, product offering and manufacturing innovation and expansion of\\nexisting businesses, such as our NIKE Direct operations, which require substantial cash investments and management attention. We believe cost-effective investments\\nare essential to business growth and profitability; however, significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business or\\nexpanding an existing business.

We base our estimates on historical experience and on\\nvarious other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in \"Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\\nResults of Operations\". The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of\\nrevenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements\\ninclude those related to revenue recognition, inventory reserves, hedge accounting for derivatives, income taxes and other contingencies. Our operating results may be\\nadversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the\\nexpectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the price of our Class B Common Stock.\\nAnti-takeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the Company or reduce the price of our common stock.\\nThere are provisions within our articles of incorporation and Oregon law intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the Board of Directors a means to attempt\\nto deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms. Such provisions include a control share acquisition\\nstatute, a freeze-out statute, two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues, and the fact that holders of Class A Common Stock elect three-quarters of the\\nBoard of Directors rounded down to the next whole number. However, such provisions could discourage, delay or prevent an unsolicited merger, acquisition or other\\nchange in control of the Company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common\\nstock over the prevailing market price. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the Company.\\nWe may fail to meet market expectations, which could cause the price of our stock to decline.\\nOur Class B Common Stock is traded publicly, and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us. These reports include\\ninformation about our historical financial results as well as analysts\\' opinions of our future performance, which may, in part, be based upon any guidance we have\\nprovided. Analysts\\' estimates are often different from our estimates or expectations. If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market\\nanalysts and investors, our stock price could decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against NIKE and other companies following a decline\\nin the market price of their securities. If our stock price is volatile for any reason, we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Any litigation could result in\\nreputational damage, substantial costs and a diversion of management\\'s attention and resources needed to successfully run our business.\\n2023 FORM 10-K 23'),\n",

MANAGEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OFFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\nOVERVIEW\\nNIKE designs, develops, markets and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and\\napparel in the world. We sell our products through NIKE Direct operations, which is comprised of both NIKE-owned retail stores and sales through our digital platforms\\n(also referred to as \"NIKE Brand Digital\"), to wholesale accounts and to a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in nearly all countries\\naround the world. Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories\\nbusinesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, \"must-have\" products, building deep personal consumer connections with our\\nbrands and delivering compelling consumer experiences through digital platforms and at retail.\\nThrough the Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy, we are focused on creating the marketplace of the future with more premium, consistent and seamless consumer\\nexperiences, leading with digital and our owned stores, as well as select wholesale partners. In addition, our product creation and marketing organizations are aligned to a\\nconsumer construct focused on sports dimensions through Men\\'s, Women\\'s and Kids\\', which allows us to better serve consumer needs. We continue to invest in a new\\nEnterprise Resource Planning Platform, data and analytics, demand sensing, insight gathering, and other areas to create an end-to-end technology foundation, which we\\nbelieve will further accelerate our digital transformation. We believe this unified approach will accelerate growth and unlock more efficiency for our business, while driving\\nspeed and responsiveness as we serve consumers globally.\\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\\n• In fiscal 2023, NIKE, Inc. achieved record Revenues of $51.2 billion, which increased 10% and 16% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, respectively\\n• NIKE Direct revenues grew 14% from $18.7 billion in fiscal 2022 to $21.3 billion in fiscal 2023, and represented approximately 44% of total NIKE Brand revenues for\\nfiscal 2023\\n• Gross margin for the fiscal year decreased 250 basis points to 43.5% primarily driven by higher product costs, higher markdowns and unfavorable changes in foreign\\ncurrency exchange rates, partially offset by strategic pricing actions\\n• Inventories as of May 31, 2023 were $8.5 billion, flat compared to the prior year, driven by the actions we took throughout fiscal 2023 to manage inventory levels\\n• We returned $7.5 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2023 through share repurchases and dividends\\n• Return on Invested Capital (\"ROIC\") as of May 31, 2023 was 31.5% compared to 46.5% as of May 31, 2022. ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, see\\n\"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for further information.\\nFor discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 refer to Part II, Item 7. Management\\'s\\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal 2022 Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange\\nCommission on July 21, 2022.\\nCURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND MARKET DYNAMICS\\n• Consumer Spending: Our fiscal 2023 growth in Revenues reflects strong demand for our products despite ongoing uncertainty in the global economy. We will\\ncontinue to closely monitor macroeconomic conditions, including potential impacts of inflation and rising interest rates on consumer behavior.\\n• Inflationary Pressures: Inflationary pressures, including higher product input, freight and logistics costs negatively impacted gross margin for fiscal 2023. The\\nstrategic pricing actions we have taken partially offset the impacts of these higher costs.\\n• Supply Chain Volatility: Supply chain challenges, macroeconomic conditions and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the manufacturing of our product\\ndisrupted the flow of seasonal product in fiscal 2022 and the first quarter of fiscal 2023, resulting in elevated inventory levels at the end of the first quarter of fiscal\\n2023. Throughout fiscal 2023, we took action to reduce excess inventory by decreasing future inventory purchases and increasing promotional activity. These\\nactions, along with the stabilization of inventory transit times in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2023, resulted in the normalization of the seasonal flow of\\nproduct in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.\\n2023 FORM 10-K 28'),\n",

At the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the government\\nmandated restrictions were lifted and we experienced improvement in physical retail traffic.\\n• Foreign Currency Impacts: As a global company with significant operations outside the United States, we are exposed to risk arising from foreign currency\\nexchange rates. For fiscal 2023, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported Revenues by approximately $2,859 million,\\nreducing our revenue growth rate to 10% on a reported basis from 16% on a currency-neutral basis. Foreign currency impacts, net of hedges, also reduced our\\nreported Income before income taxes by approximately $1,023 million. For further information, refer to \"Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices\".\\nThe operating environment could remain volatile in fiscal 2024 as the risk exists that worsening macroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse impact on our\\nfuture revenue growth as well as overall profitability. For more information refer to Item 1A Risk Factors, within Part I, Item 1. Business.\\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\\nDuring the first and second quarters of fiscal 2023, we completed the sale of our entity in Chile and our entities in Argentina and Uruguay to third-party distributors,\\nrespectively. Now that we have completed the shift from a wholesale and direct to consumer operating model to a distributor model within our Central and South America\\n(\"CASA\") territory, we expect consolidated NIKE, Inc. and Asia Pacific & Latin America (\"APLA\") revenue growth will be reduced due to different commercial terms.\\nHowever, over time we expect the future operating model to have a favorable impact on our overall profitability as we reduce selling and administrative expenses, as well\\nas reduce exposure to foreign exchange rate volatility.\\nUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\\nThroughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, the financial\\nmeasures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. References to these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other\\nfinancial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\\nManagement uses these non-GAAP measures when evaluating the Company\\'s performance, including when making financial and operating decisions. Additionally,\\nmanagement believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional financial information that should be considered when assessing our\\nunderlying business performance and trends.\\nEarnings Before Interest and Taxes (\"EBIT\"): Calculated as Net income before Interest expense (income), net and Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements\\nof Income.

Currency-neutral revenues are calculated using actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period in place of the\\nexchange rates in use during the current period.\\nWholesale equivalent revenues: References to wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total size of our NIKE Brand market footprint if\\nwe had no NIKE Direct operations. NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of (1) sales to external wholesale customers and (2) internal sales from our\\nwholesale operations to our NIKE Direct operations, which are charged at prices comparable to those charged to external wholesale customers.\\nCOMPARABLE STORE SALES\\nComparable store sales: This key metric, which excludes NIKE Brand Digital sales, comprises revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of\\nthe following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and\\n(3) the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year. Comparable store sales includes revenues from stores that were temporarily closed during the\\nperiod as a result of COVID-19. Comparable store sales represents a performance metric that we believe is useful information for management and investors in\\nunderstanding the performance of our established NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores. Management considers this metric when making financial and operating\\ndecisions. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of this metric may not be comparable to similarly\\ntitled metrics used by other companies.\\n(1)\\n(2)\\n2023 FORM 10-K 30'),\n",

Revenues, respectively.\\n• NIKE Brand revenues, which represented over 90% of NIKE, Inc. Revenues, increased 10% and 16% on a reported and currency-neutral basis, respectively.

Unit\\nsales of footwear increased 13%, while higher average selling price (\"ASP\") per pair contributed approximately 7 percentage points of footwear revenue\\ngrowth. Higher ASP was primarily due to higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, on a wholesale equivalent basis, and growth in the size of our NIKE Direct\\nbusiness, partially offset by lower NIKE Direct ASP.\\n• NIKE Brand apparel revenues increased 8% on a currency-neutral basis, primarily due to higher revenues in Men\\'s.

Higher ASP was primarily due to higher full-price ASP and\\ngrowth in the size of our NIKE Direct business, partially offset by lower NIKE Direct ASP, reflecting higher promotional activity.\\n• NIKE Direct revenues increased 14% from $18.7 billion in fiscal 2022 to $21.3 billion in fiscal 2023. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Direct revenues increased\\n20% primarily driven by NIKE Brand Digital sales growth of 24%, comparable store sales growth of 14% and the addition of new stores.

NIKE Direct revenues increased 22%, driven by digital sales growth of 23% and comparable store sales growth of 28%.\\n• Footwear revenues increased 19% on a currency-neutral basis, primarily due to higher revenues in Men's, Women's and the Jordan Brand. Unit sales of footwear\\nincreased 16%, while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 3 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was primarily due to\\nhigher full-price ASP and growth in NIKE Direct, partially offset by lower NIKE Direct ASP.\\n• Apparel revenues increased 13% on a currency-neutral basis, primarily due to higher revenues in Men's. Unit sales of apparel increased 9%, while higher ASP per\\nunit contributed approximately 4 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. Higher ASP per unit was primarily due to higher full-price and off-price ASPs, partially\\noffset by lower NIKE Direct ASP.\\nReported EBIT increased 2% due to higher revenues and the following:\\n• Gross margin contraction of approximately 190 basis points primarily due to higher product costs, reflecting product mix and higher input costs, as well as\\nunfavorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates. This was partially offset by higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, due to product mix and strategic\\npricing actions.\\n• Selling and administrative expense increased 8% due to higher operating overhead and demand creation expense. Operating overhead expense increased primarily\\ndue to higher wage-related expenses and an increase in NIKE Direct variable costs, partially offset by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\\nDemand creation expense increased primarily due to higher sports marketing expense and higher advertising and marketing expense, partially offset by favorable\\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates.\\n2023 FORM 10-K 40\"),\n",

Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign\\ncurrency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars.\\nOur foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of\\noperations, financial position and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to NIKE, Inc. We\\nmanage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and, where practical and material, by hedging a\\nportion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation of the NIKE Trading\\nCompany (\"NTC\") and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency\\ncorrelation benefits existing within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate\\nchanges on the underlying net exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on\\nour Consolidated Financial Statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or\\nspeculative purposes.\\n2023 FORM 10-K 42'),\n",

Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures\\nare:\\n• Product Costs — NIKE\\'s product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\\n1. Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\\na. Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories,\\npredominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional\\ncurrencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.\\nb. Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those\\nNIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\\nIn both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.\\n2. Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign\\ncurrency risk by assuming certain of the factories\\' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures.\\nUnder this program, our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (\"factory currency exposure index\") in which the\\nlabor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products (\"factory input costs\") are denominated.\\nAs an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening\\nU.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces NIKE\\'s U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening\\nU.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.\\n• Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales — A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned in\\ncurrencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a\\nforeign currency exposure.\\n• Other Costs — Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent.\\n• Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities — Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and\\npayables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject\\nto remeasurement which may create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our Consolidated Statements of Income.\\nMANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\\nTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of\\nnatural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of\\nexchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and\\nother costs described above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges.\\n2023 FORM 10-K 43'),\n",

Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are recognized in Other (income) expense,\\nnet and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the remeasurement of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability being hedged.\\nTRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES\\nMany of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results\\nas we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of\\nforeign subsidiaries\\' non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to\\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Shareholders\\' equity. In the translation of our Consolidated Statements of Income, a weaker U.S. Dollar in relation\\nto foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate\\nfluctuations on the translation of our consolidated Revenues was a detriment of approximately $2,859 million, $295 million and a benefit of approximately $893 million for\\nthe years ended May 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income before income taxes was a\\ndetriment of approximately $824 million, $87 million and a benefit of approximately $260 million for the years ended May 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\\nMANAGING TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES\\nTo minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use\\nexcess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of\\nthese U.S. Dollar denominated investments at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting\\nunder generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"). We utilize forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the\\nforecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination of the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging\\ninstrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold. Hedges of the\\npurchase of U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges.\\nWe estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency\\nrelated gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact of approximately $1,023 million and a favorable impact of approximately\\n$132 million and $19 million on our Income before income taxes for the years ended May 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\\nNET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES\\nWe are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the\\nU.S. Dollar, which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We have, in the past, hedged\\nand may, in the future, hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments.\\nThese hedges are accounted for as net investment hedges in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2023 and\\n2022. There were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\\nCASH FLOW ACTIVITY\\nCash provided (used) by operations was an inflow of $5,841 million for fiscal 2023, compared to $5,188 million for fiscal 2022.

The net change in working capital and other assets and\\nliabilities resulted in a decrease to Cash provided (used) by operations of $513 million for fiscal 2023 compared to a decrease of $1,660 million for fiscal 2022. For fiscal\\n2023, the net change in working capital compared to the prior year was impacted by unfavorable changes in Accounts payable, offset by favorable impacts from\\nInventories and Accounts receivable. These changes were, in part, due to reduced inventory purchases in the current period and timing of wholesale shipments. Further\\nimpacting these changes was a lower available supply of inventory in the prior year due to supply chain constraints.\\nCash provided (used) by investing activities was an inflow of $564 million for fiscal 2023, compared to an outflow of $1,524 million for fiscal 2022, primarily driven by the\\nnet change in short-term investments.

In August 2022, we\\nterminated the previous four-year, $15 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in June 2018. Under this program, we repurchased 6.5 million\\nshares for a total approximate cost of $710.0 million (an average price of $109.85 per share) during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and 83.8 million shares for a total\\napproximate cost of $9.4 billion (an average price of $111.82 per share) during the term of the program. Upon termination of the four-year, $15 billion program, we began\\npurchasing shares under the new four-year, $18 billion share repurchase plan authorized by the Board of Directors in June 2022. As of May 31, 2023, we had\\nrepurchased 43.5 million shares at a cost of approximately $4.8 billion (an average price of $110.38 per share) under this new program. We continue to expect funding of\\nshare repurchases will come from operating cash flows. The timing and the amount of share repurchases will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market\\nconditions.\\nCAPITAL RESOURCES\\nOn July 21, 2022, we filed a shelf registration statement (the \"Shelf\") with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") which permits us to issue an\\nunlimited amount of debt securities from time to time. The Shelf expires on July 21, 2025.\\nOn March 11, 2022, we entered into a five-year committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings, with the\\noption to increase borrowings up to $3 billion in total with lender approval. The facility matures on March 11, 2027, with options to extend the maturity date up to an\\nadditional two years. This facility replaces the prior $2 billion five-year credit facility agreement entered into on August 16, 2019, which would have matured on August 16,\\n2024. Refer to Note 5 — Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines for additional information.\\nOn March 10, 2023, we entered into a 364-day committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $1 billion of borrowings, with the\\noption to increase borrowings up to $1.5 billion in total with lender approval. The facility matures on March 8, 2024, with an option to extend the maturity date by 364 days.\\nThis facility replaces the prior $1 billion 364-day credit facility agreement entered into on March 11, 2022, which matured on March 10, 2023. Refer to Note 5 — Short-\\nTerm Borrowings and Credit Lines for additional information.\\nWe currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor\\'s Corporation and Moody\\'s Investor Services, respectively. As it relates to our committed\\ncredit facilities entered into on March 11, 2022 and March 10, 2023, if our long-term debt ratings were to decline, the facility fees and interest rates would increase.\\nConversely, if our long-term debt ratings were to improve, the facility fees and interest rates would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt ratings would not trigger\\nacceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facilities. Under these facilities, we have agreed to\\nvarious covenants. These covenants include limits on the disposal of assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur. In the event we were to have any\\nborrowings outstanding under these facilities, failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the applicable syndicate, any\\nborrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31, 2023, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants, and we believe it is unlikely we will\\nfail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future.\\nLiquidity is also provided by our $3 billion commercial paper program. As of and for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2023 and 2022, we did not have any borrowings\\noutstanding under our $3 billion program.\\nWe may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities depending on general corporate needs.\\nTo date, we have not experienced difficulty accessing the capital or credit markets; however, future volatility may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper\\nor other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets.\\nAs of May 31, 2023, we had Cash and equivalents and Short-term investments totaling $10.7 billion, primarily consisting of commercial paper, corporate notes, deposits\\nheld at major banks, money market funds, U.S. Treasury obligations and other investment grade fixed-income securities. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to\\nboth credit and interest rate risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk.

If actual or expected future returns, discounts or claims were significantly\\ndifferent than reserves established, a reduction or increase to net revenues would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made.\\nRefer to Note 14 — Revenues in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\\nINVENTORY RESERVES\\nWe make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate the\\nnet realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the\\ninventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions to the\\nestimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination. \\nHEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES\\nWe use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain non-functional currency monetary assets and\\nliabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are\\nrecorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), rather than Net income, until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income. In most cases, this\\nresults in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into Net income sometime after the maturity of the\\nderivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of the designated amount of\\nanticipated transactions. By their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When\\nthe designated amount of anticipated or actual transactions decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the\\noriginally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of\\nthe related hedge contract from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs. In rare\\ncircumstances, the additional period of time may exceed two months due to extenuating circumstances related to the nature of the forecasted transaction that are outside\\nour control or influence.\\nRefer to Note 12 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\\n2023 FORM 10-K 47'),\n",

The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant\\njudgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. On an interim basis, we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year.\\nThis estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date Income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the\\nyear-to-date Income tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year\\nprogresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results\\nin a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate\\noccurs.\\nOn a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions\\nbased on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the\\nrecognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax\\nmatters in Income tax expense.\\nRefer to Note 7 — Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\\nOTHER CONTINGENCIES\\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings, claims and government investigations related to our business, products and actions of our\\nemployees and representatives, including contractual and employment relationships, product liability, antitrust, customs, tax, intellectual property and other matters. We\\nrecord contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing\\nprobability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party\\nclaimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future\\nadjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges during the period in\\nwhich the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a\\nreasonable possibility the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability.\\nRefer to Note 16 — Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\\n2023 FORM 10-K 48'),\n",

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURESABOUT MARKET RISK\\nIn the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations\\nin the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such\\nexposures; we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes.\\nWe are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk\\nmanagement program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and\\ncash flows. We use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated, but not yet firmly committed, transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the\\nrelated receivables and payables, including third-party and intercompany transactions. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of\\nexchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nThe timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon\\nthe nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted\\ntransaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The majority of derivatives outstanding as of\\nMay 31, 2023, are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro, Chinese Yuan/U.S. Dollar, and Japanese Yen/U.S.\\nDollar currency pairs. Refer to Note 12 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional\\ninformation.\\nOur earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of\\ninterest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans,\\nand fixed-rate debt of varying maturities.\\nMARKET RISK MEASUREMENT\\nWe monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis and Value-\\nat-Risk (\"VaR\"). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, intercompany\\nloans denominated in non-functional currencies and fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt.\\nWe use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the\\nmaximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market\\nconditions and a 95% confidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on\\ninterrelationships between currencies and interest rates (a \"variance/co-variance\" technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market\\nchanges and interest rate changes over the preceding one-year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the\\nunderlying currency rate. We adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the \"delta\" and \"gamma\") to changes in the underlying currency rate.\\nThis calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non-\\nfunctional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those\\nwhich are hedged by these instruments.\\nThe VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable\\nchanges in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated\\nbecause of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.\\nThe estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $111 million and\\n$99 million as of May 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The VaR increased year-over-year as a result of an increase in foreign currency volatilities as of May 31, 2023.\\nSuch a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly\\nchange in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $289 million and $170 million during fiscal 2023 and fiscal\\n2022, respectively.\\nThe instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies and fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt.\\nIntercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, our non-functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged\\nagainst foreign exchange risk through the use of forward\\n2023 FORM 10-K 49'),\n",

The NIKE Brand is focused on performance athletic footwear, apparel, equipment,\\naccessories and services across Men\\'s, Women\\'s and Kids\\', amplified with sport-inspired lifestyle products carrying the Swoosh trademark, as well as other NIKE Brand\\ntrademarks. The Jordan Brand is focused on athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories using the Jumpman trademark. Sales and operating results of Jordan\\nBrand products are reported within the respective NIKE Brand geographic operating segments. Converse designs, distributes, licenses and sells casual sneakers, apparel\\nand accessories under the Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell trademarks. In some markets outside the U.S., these trademarks\\nare licensed to third parties who design, distribute, market and sell similar products. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis.\\nBASIS OF CONSOLIDATION\\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\" or \"NIKE\"). All significant intercompany transactions and\\nbalances have been eliminated.\\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\\nRevenue transactions associated with the sale of NIKE Brand footwear, apparel and equipment, as well as Converse products, comprise a single performance obligation,\\nwhich consists of the sale of products to customers either through wholesale or direct to consumer channels. The Company satisfies the performance obligation and\\nrecords revenues when transfer of control to the customer has occurred, based on the terms of sale. A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct\\nthe use and receive substantially all of the benefits of the product.\\nControl is transferred to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Control transfers\\nto retail store customers at the time of sale and to substantially all digital commerce customers upon shipment. The transaction price is determined based upon the\\ninvoiced sales price, less anticipated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. Payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the country\\nof sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 90 days or less of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer. Payment is due at\\nthe time of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions.\\nConsideration for trademark licensing contracts is earned through sales-based or usage-based royalty arrangements, and the associated revenues are recognized over\\nthe license period.\\nTaxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, and are collected by the Company\\nfrom a customer, are excluded from Revenues and Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight\\nafter control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in Cost of sales when the related revenues are\\nrecognized.\\nSALES-RELATED RESERVES\\nConsideration promised in the Company\\'s contracts with customers is variable due to anticipated reductions, such as sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims\\nfrom customers. The Company estimates the most likely amount it will be entitled to receive and records an anticipated reduction against Revenues, with an offsetting\\nincrease to Accrued liabilities at the time revenues are recognized. The estimated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current\\nassets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\nThe provision for anticipated sales returns consists of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns. Provisions for post-invoice sales discounts\\nconsist of both contractual programs and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date.\\nEstimates of discretionary authorized returns, discounts and claims are based on (1) historical rates, (2) specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from\\ncustomers and outstanding discounts and claims and (3) estimated returns, discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with customers. Actual returns, discounts\\nand claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from estimates recorded. If actual or expected future returns, discounts or claims are\\nsignificantly greater or lower than the reserves established, a reduction or increase to net Revenues is recorded in the period in which such determination is made.\\n2023 FORM 10-K 61'),\n",

Shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in Cost of sales.\\nDEMAND CREATION EXPENSE\\nDemand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, complimentary products, television, digital and print\\nadvertising as well as media costs, brand events and retail brand presentation. Advertising production costs are expensed the first time an advertisement is run.\\nAdvertising media costs are expensed when the advertisement appears. Costs related to brand events are expensed when the event occurs. Costs related to retail brand\\npresentation are expensed when the presentation is complete and delivered.\\nA significant amount of the Company's promotional expenses result from payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed on a\\nstraight-line basis over the term of the contract. However, certain contracts contain elements that may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and\\ncircumstances of each individual contract. Prepayments made under contracts are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Deferred income taxes and\\nother assets depending on the period to which the prepayment applies.\\nCertain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sport (e.g., winning a championship). The Company records\\nDemand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal.\\nCertain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining\\na specified ranking in a sport for a year). When the Company determines payments are probable, the amounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the\\ncontract period based on the Company's best estimate of the endorser's performance. In these instances, to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from the\\nCompany's estimate due to changes in the endorser's performance, adjustments to Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period.\\nCertain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products, which the Company records in Cost of\\nsales as the related sales occur. For contracts containing minimum guaranteed royalty payments, the Company records the amount of any guaranteed payment in excess\\nof that earned through sales of product within Demand creation expense.\\nThrough cooperative advertising programs, the Company reimburses its wholesale customers for certain costs of advertising the Company's products. To the extent the\\nCompany receives a distinct good or service in exchange for consideration paid to the customer that does not exceed the fair value of that good or service, the amounts\\nreimbursed are recorded in Demand creation expense.\\nTotal Demand creation expense was $4,060 million, $3,850 million and $3,114 million for the years ended May 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Prepaid advertising\\nand promotion expenses totaled $755 million and $773 million at May 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, of which $372 million and $329 million, respectively, were recorded\\nin Prepaid expenses and other current assets, and $383 million and $444 million, respectively, were recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets, depending on\\nthe period to which the prepayment applied.\\nOPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSE\\nOperating overhead expense consists primarily of wage and benefit-related expenses, research and development costs, bad debt expense as well as other administrative\\nexpenses such as rent, depreciation and amortization, professional services, certain technology investments, meetings and travel.\\nCASH AND EQUIVALENTS\\nCash and equivalents represent cash and short-term, highly liquid investments, that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near their maturity they\\npresent insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates, with maturities three months or less at the date of purchase.\\n2023 FORM 10-K 62\"),\n",

At May 31, 2023 and 2022, Short-term investments\\nconsisted of available-for-sale debt securities, which are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, in Accumulated other comprehensive\\nincome (loss), unless unrealized losses are determined to be unrecoverable. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification.\\nThe Company considers all available-for-sale debt securities, including those with maturity dates beyond 12 months, as available to support current operational liquidity\\nneeds and, therefore, classifies all securities with maturity dates beyond three months at the date of purchase as current assets within Short-term investments on the\\nConsolidated Balance Sheets.\\nRefer to Note 4 — Fair Value Measurements for more information on the Company's Short-term investments.\\nALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE\\nAccounts receivable, net consist primarily of amounts due from customers. The Company makes ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of its accounts receivable\\nand maintains an allowance for expected losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. In addition to judgments about the\\ncreditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations, the Company considers historical levels of credit losses, as well as macroeconomic and\\nindustry trends to determine the amount of the allowance. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $35 million and $34 million as of May 31, 2023 and\\n2022, respectively.\\nINVENTORY VALUATION\\nInventories, substantially all of which are finished goods, are stated at lower of cost and net realizable value and valued on either an average or a specific identification\\ncost basis. In some instances, the Company ships products directly from its suppliers to the customer, with the related inventory and cost of sales recognized on a specific\\nidentification basis. Inventory costs primarily consist of product cost from the Company's suppliers, as well as inbound freight, import duties, taxes, insurance, logistics and\\nother handling fees.\\nPROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION\\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is determined on a straight-line basis for land improvements, buildings and leasehold improvements over\\n2 to 40 years and for machinery and equipment over 2 to 15 years.\\nDepreciation and amortization of assets used in manufacturing, warehousing and product distribution are recorded in Cost of sales. Depreciation and amortization of all\\nother assets are recorded in Operating overhead expense.\\nSOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS\\nExpenditures for major software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and amortized over 2 to 12 years on a straight-line basis. The\\nCompany's policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software. The Company also\\ncapitalizes certain payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects. The amount of capitalizable\\npayroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects. Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training,\\nmaintenance and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred.\\nDevelopment costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed as an integral part of a product are subject to capitalization beginning when a product's\\ntechnological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Company's products are\\nreleased soon after technological feasibility has been established; therefore, software development costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility\\nare usually not significant, and generally, most software development costs have been expensed as incurred.\\n2023 FORM 10-K 63\"),\n",

Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in\\nwhich an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the\\nobservable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, the Company would assess the recoverability of an asset group by\\ndetermining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of\\nthe assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not\\nrecoverable, the Company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would typically include an estimate of\\ndiscounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset group\\'s carrying amount and its estimated fair value.\\nGOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS\\nThe Company performs annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when events occur or\\ncircumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value.\\nFor purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, the Company allocates goodwill across its reporting units, which are considered the Company\\'s operating segments. For\\nboth goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks, the Company may first assess qualitative factors to\\ndetermine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life is less than its carrying amount. If, after\\nassessing the totality of events and circumstances, the Company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible\\nasset is greater than its carrying amount, an impairment test is unnecessary.\\nIf an impairment test is necessary, the Company will estimate the fair value of the related reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset. If the carrying value of a\\nreporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is determined to be impaired\\nand the Company will record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value over the related fair value.\\nThere were no accumulated impairment losses as of May 31, 2023 and 2022. Additionally, the impact to Goodwill as a result of acquisitions and divestitures during fiscal\\n2023 and 2022, was not material.\\nOPERATING LEASES\\nThe Company primarily leases retail store space, certain distribution and warehouse facilities, office space, equipment and other non-real estate assets. The Company\\ndetermines if an arrangement is a lease at inception and begins recording lease activity at the commencement date, which is generally the date in which the Company\\ntakes possession of or controls the physical use of the asset. Lease components are not separated from non-lease components for real estate leases within the\\nCompany\\'s lease portfolio. Right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term with lease\\nexpense recognized on a straight-line basis. The Company\\'s incremental borrowing rate is used to determine the present value of future lease payments unless the\\nimplicit rate is readily determinable.\\nLease agreements may contain rent escalation clauses, renewal or termination options, rent holidays or certain landlord incentives, including tenant improvement\\nallowances. ROU assets include amounts for scheduled rent increases and are reduced by the amount of lease incentives. The lease term includes the non-cancelable\\nperiod of the lease and options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise those options. The Company does not record\\nleases with an initial term of 12 months or less on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognizes related lease payments in the Consolidated Statements of Income on\\na straight-line basis over the lease term. Certain lease agreements include variable lease payments, which are based on a percent of retail sales over specified levels or\\nadjust periodically for inflation as a result of changes in a published index, primarily the Consumer Price Index, and are expensed as incurred.\\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\\nThe Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives, equity securities and available-for-sale debt\\nsecurities. Fair value is the price the Company would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the\\nmeasurement date. The Company uses a three-level hierarchy that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used, as follows:\\n2023 FORM 10-K 64'),\n",

Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the most conservative level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\\nPricing vendors are utilized for a majority of Level 1 and Level 2 investments. These vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable\\ninputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted\\nintervals, volatilities and credit risks. The fair value of derivative contracts is determined using observable market inputs such as the daily market foreign currency rates,\\nforward pricing curves, currency volatilities, currency correlations and interest rates and considers nonperformance risk of the Company and its counterparties.\\nThe Company\\'s fair value measurement process includes comparing fair values to another independent pricing vendor to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded.\\nRefer to Note 4 — Fair Value Measurements for additional information.\\nFOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS\\nAdjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. Dollars are included in the foreign currency translation adjustment, a\\ncomponent of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\\nThe Company\\'s global subsidiaries have various monetary assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, which are denominated in currencies other than their\\nfunctional currency. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement, the impact of which is recorded in Other (income) expense, net, within the Consolidated\\nStatements of Income.\\nACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. All derivatives are recorded at\\nfair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive\\nincome (loss), Long-term debt or Net income depending on the nature of the underlying exposure, whether the derivative is formally designated as a hedge and, if\\ndesignated, the extent to which the hedge is effective. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from\\nthe related hedged items.

This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected\\nfuture tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance to\\nreduce deferred tax assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable\\nearnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, the Company assesses taxable income in prior carryback periods, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities,\\nprojected future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. The Company uses forecasts of taxable income and considers foreign tax credit utilization in making\\nthis assessment of realization, which are inherently uncertain and can result in significant variation between estimated and actual results. To the extent the Company\\nbelieves that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established against the net deferred tax asset, which increases the Company\\'s income tax expense in the\\nperiod when such determination is made.\\nThe Company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon\\nexamination by relevant tax authorities. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense.\\nRefer to Note 7 — Income Taxes for further discussion.\\nEARNINGS PER SHARE\\nBasic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing Net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings\\nper common share is calculated by adjusting weighted average outstanding shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options and awards.\\nRefer to Note 10 — Earnings Per Share for further discussion.\\nMANAGEMENT ESTIMATES\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, including estimates relating\\nto assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the\\nreported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Additionally, the macroeconomic environment\\ncould remain volatile as the risk exists that worsening macroeconomic conditions could have a material, adverse impact on future revenue growth as well as overall\\nprofitability.\\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\\nIn September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") ASU 2022-04, Liabilities — Supplier Finance\\nPrograms (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations, which enhances transparency surrounding the use of supplier finance programs. The\\nnew guidance requires qualitative and quantitative disclosure sufficient to enable users of the financial statements to understand the nature, activity during the period,\\nchanges from period to period and potential magnitude of such programs. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including\\ninterim periods within those fiscal periods, except for the amendment on rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. The\\nCompany will adopt the required guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and is currently evaluating the ASU to determine its impact on the Company\\'s disclosures.\\n2023 FORM 10-K 66'),\n",

Stock Incentive Plan (the \"Stock Incentive Plan\") provides for the issuance of up to 798 million previously unissued shares of Class B Common Stock in\\nconnection with equity awards granted under the Stock Incentive Plan. The Stock Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of non-statutory stock options, incentive stock\\noptions, stock appreciation rights, and stock awards, including restricted stock and restricted stock units. Restricted stock units include both time-vesting restricted stock\\nunits (\"RSUs\") as well as performance-based restricted stock units (\"PSUs\"). A committee of the Board of Directors administers the Stock Incentive Plan and has the\\nauthority to determine the employees to whom awards will be made, the amount of the awards and the other terms and conditions of the awards. The Company generally\\ngrants stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units on an annual basis. The exercise price for stock options and stock appreciation rights may not be less than\\nthe fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant.

In rare\\ncircumstances, the additional period of time may exceed two months due to extenuating circumstances related to the nature of the forecasted transaction that are outside\\nthe control or influence of the Company.\\nThe purpose of the Company\\'s foreign exchange risk management program is to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on the Company\\'s\\nconsolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

NIKE entities primarily purchase\\nproduct in two ways: (1) Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NIKE Trading Company (\"NTC\"), a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products\\nfrom third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the product to NIKE entities in their respective\\nfunctional currencies.

(2) Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure\\nfor those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\\nThe Company's policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or other strategies cannot be effectively\\nemployed. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental\\nhedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as\\ncash flow hedges was $18.2 billion as of May 31, 2023.\\nAs of May 31, 2023, approximately $419 million of deferred net gains (net of tax) on both outstanding and matured derivatives in Accumulated other comprehensive\\nincome (loss) are expected to be reclassified to Net income during the next 12 months concurrent with the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in Net\\nincome. Actual amounts ultimately reclassified to Net income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts currently outstanding mature. As of\\nMay 31, 2023, the maximum term over which the Company hedges exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted transactions was 27 months.\\nFAIR VALUE HEDGES\\nThe Company has, in the past, been exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. Derivatives used by\\nthe Company to hedge this risk are receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. The Company had no interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges as of\\nMay 31, 2023.\\nNET INVESTMENT HEDGES\\nThe Company has, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge the risk of variability in foreign currency-denominated net investments in wholly-owned international\\noperations. All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment hedges are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) along with\\nthe foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments. The Company had no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2023.\\nUNDESIGNATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\\nThe Company may elect to enter into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\nThese undesignated instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair\\nvalue recognized in Other (income) expense, net, together with the remeasurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position. The total notional amount of\\noutstanding undesignated derivative instruments was $4.7 billion as of May 31, 2023.\\nCREDIT RISK\\nThe Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to hedging instruments. The counterparties to all derivative\\ntransactions are major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings; however, this does not eliminate the Company's exposure to credit risk with these\\ninstitutions. This credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted. To manage this risk, the\\nCompany has established strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored.\\nThe Company's derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features designed to protect against significant deterioration in counterparties' creditworthiness\\nand their ultimate ability to settle outstanding derivative contracts in the normal course of business. The Company's bilateral credit-related contingent features generally\\nrequire the owing entity, either the Company or the derivative counterparty, to post collateral for the portion of the fair value in excess of $50 million should the fair value of\\noutstanding derivatives per counterparty be greater than $50 million. Additionally, a certain level of decline in credit rating of either the Company or the counterparty could\\ntrigger collateral requirements. As of May 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all credit risk-related contingent features, and derivative instruments with such\\nfeatures were in a net liability position of approximately $2 million. Accordingly, the Company posted no cash collateral as a result of these contingent features. Further, as\\nof May 31, 2023, the Company had received $36 million in cash collateral from various counterparties to its derivative contracts.

Currently, the Company has several such agreements in place. However, based\\non the Company's historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, the Company has determined the fair value of such indemnification is not material to\\nthe Company's financial position or results of operations.\\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to various legal proceedings, claims and government investigations relating to its business, products and\\nactions of its employees and representatives, including contractual and employment relationships, product liability, antitrust, customs, tax, intellectual property and other\\nmatters. The outcome of these legal matters is inherently uncertain, and the Company cannot predict the eventual outcome of currently pending matters, the timing of\\ntheir ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences relating to those matters. When a loss related to a legal proceeding or claim is probable\\nand reasonably estimable, the Company accrues its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of the matter. If one or more legal matters were to be resolved against the\\nCompany in a reporting period for amounts above management's expectations, the Company's financial position, operating results and cash flows for that reporting period\\ncould be materially adversely affected. In the opinion of management, based on its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, the Company does not believe\\nany currently pending legal matters will have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows, except as described\\nbelow.\\nBELGIAN CUSTOMS CLAIMThe Company has received claims for certain years from the Belgian Customs Authorities for alleged underpaid duties related to products imported beginning in fiscal\\n2018. The Company disputes these claims and has engaged in the appellate process. The Company has issued bank guarantees in order to appeal the claims. At this\\ntime, the Company is unable to estimate the range of loss and cannot predict the final outcome as it could take several years to reach a resolution on this matter. If this\\nmatter is ultimately resolved against the Company, the amounts owed, including fines, penalties and other consequences relating to the matter, could have a material\\nadverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\\nNOTE 17 — LEASES\\nLease expense is recognized in Cost of sales or Operating overhead expense within the Consolidated Statements of Income, based on the underlying nature of the\\nleased asset.

Shen et al.\\n\\n37], layout detection [38, 22], table detection [26], and scene text detection [4].\\nA generalized learning-based framework dramatically reduces the need for the\\nmanual speciﬁcation of complicated rules, which is the status quo with traditional\\nmethods. DL has the potential to transform DIA pipelines and beneﬁt a broad\\nspectrum of large-scale document digitization projects.\\n\\nHowever, there are several practical diﬃculties for taking advantages of re-\\ncent advances in DL-based methods: 1) DL models are notoriously convoluted\\nfor reuse and extension. Existing models are developed using distinct frame-\\nworks like TensorFlow [1] or PyTorch [24], and the high-level parameters can\\nbe obfuscated by implementation details [8]. It can be a time-consuming and\\nfrustrating experience to debug, reproduce, and adapt existing models for DIA,\\nand many researchers who would beneﬁt the most from using these methods lack\\nthe technical background to implement them from scratch. 2) Document images\\ncontain diverse and disparate patterns across domains, and customized training\\nis often required to achieve a desirable detection accuracy. Currently there is no\\nfull-ﬂedged infrastructure for easily curating the target document image datasets\\nand ﬁne-tuning or re-training the models. 3) DIA usually requires a sequence of\\nmodels and other processing to obtain the ﬁnal outputs. Often research teams use\\nDL models and then perform further document analyses in separate processes,\\nand these pipelines are not documented in any central location (and often not\\ndocumented at all). This makes it diﬃcult for research teams to learn about how\\nfull pipelines are implemented and leads them to invest signiﬁcant resources in\\nreinventing the DIA wheel.\\n\\nLayoutParser provides a uniﬁed toolkit to support DL-based document image\\nanalysis and processing. To address the aforementioned challenges, LayoutParser\\nis built with the following components:\\n\\n1. An oﬀ-the-shelf toolkit for applying DL models for layout detection, character\\n\\nrecognition, and other DIA tasks (Section 3)\\n\\n2. A rich repository of pre-trained neural network models (Model Zoo) that\\n\\nunderlies the oﬀ-the-shelf usage\\n\\n3. Comprehensive tools for eﬃcient document image data annotation and model\\n\\ntuning to support diﬀerent levels of customization\\n\\n4. A DL model hub and community platform for the easy sharing, distribu-\\ntion, and discussion of DIA models and pipelines, to promote reusability,\\nreproducibility, and extensibility (Section 4)\\n\\nThe library implements simple and intuitive Python APIs without sacriﬁcing\\ngeneralizability and versatility, and can be easily installed via pip. Its convenient\\nfunctions for handling document image data can be seamlessly integrated with\\nexisting DIA pipelines. With detailed documentations and carefully curated\\ntutorials, we hope this tool will beneﬁt a variety of end-users, and will lead to\\nadvances in applications in both industry and academic research.\\n\\nLayoutParser is well aligned with recent eﬀorts for improving DL model\\nreusability in other disciplines like natural language processing [8, 34] and com-\\nputer vision [35], but with a focus on unique challenges in DIA. We show\\nLayoutParser can be applied in sophisticated and large-scale digitization projects\\n\\n\\x0cLayoutParser: A Uniﬁed Toolkit for DL-Based DIA\\n\\n3\\n\\nthat require precision, eﬃciency, and robustness, as well as simple and light-\\nweight document processing tasks focusing on eﬃcacy and ﬂexibility (Section 5).\\nLayoutParser is being actively maintained, and support for more deep learning\\nmodels and novel methods in text-based layout analysis methods [37, 34] is\\nplanned.\\n\\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview\\nof related work. The core LayoutParser library, DL Model Zoo, and customized\\nmodel training are described in Section 3, and the DL model hub and commu-\\nnity platform are detailed in Section 4. Section 5 shows two examples of how\\nLayoutParser can be used in practical DIA projects, and Section 6 concludes.\\n\\n2 Related Work\\n\\nRecently, various DL models and datasets have been developed for layout analysis\\ntasks. The dhSegment [22] utilizes fully convolutional networks [20] for segmen-\\ntation tasks on historical documents. Object detection-based methods like Faster\\nR-CNN [28] and Mask R-CNN [12] are used for identifying document elements [38]\\nand detecting tables [30, 26]. Most recently, Graph Neural Networks [29] have also\\nbeen used in table detection [27]. However, these models are usually implemented\\nindividually and there is no uniﬁed framework to load and use such models.\\n\\nThere has been a surge of interest in creating open-source tools for document\\nimage processing: a search of document image analysis in Github leads to 5M\\nrelevant code pieces 6; yet most of them rely on traditional rule-based methods\\nor provide limited functionalities. The closest prior research to our work is the\\nOCR-D project7, which also tries to build a complete toolkit for DIA. However,\\nsimilar to the platform developed by Neudecker et al. [21], it is designed for\\nanalyzing historical documents, and provides no supports for recent DL models.\\nThe DocumentLayoutAnalysis project8 focuses on processing born-digital PDF\\ndocuments via analyzing the stored PDF data. Repositories like DeepLayout9\\nand Detectron2-PubLayNet10 are individual deep learning models trained on\\nlayout analysis datasets without support for the full DIA pipeline. The Document\\nAnalysis and Exploitation (DAE) platform [15] and the DeepDIVA project [2]\\naim to improve the reproducibility of DIA methods (or DL models), yet they\\nare not actively maintained. OCR engines like Tesseract [14], easyOCR11 and\\npaddleOCR12 usually do not come with comprehensive functionalities for other\\nDIA tasks like layout analysis.\\n\\nRecent years have also seen numerous eﬀorts to create libraries for promoting\\nreproducibility and reusability in the ﬁeld of DL. Libraries like Dectectron2 [35],\\n\\n6 The number shown is obtained by specifying the search type as ‘code’.\\n7 https://ocr-d.de/en/about\\n8 https://github.com/BobLd/DocumentLayoutAnalysis\\n9 https://github.com/leonlulu/DeepLayout\\n10 https://github.com/hpanwar08/detectron2\\n11 https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR\\n12 https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR\\n\\n\\x0c4\\n\\nZ.

For “base model” and “large model”, we refer to using the ResNet 50 or ResNet 101\\nbackbones [13], respectively. One can train models of diﬀerent architectures, like Faster R-CNN [28] (F) and Mask\\nR-CNN [12] (M). For example, an F in the Large Model column indicates it has a Faster R-CNN model trained\\nusing the ResNet 101 backbone. The platform is maintained and a number of additions will be made to the model\\nzoo in coming months.\\n\\nlayout data structures, which are optimized for eﬃciency and versatility. 3) When\\nnecessary, users can employ existing or customized OCR models via the uniﬁed\\nAPI provided in the OCR module. 4) LayoutParser comes with a set of utility\\nfunctions for the visualization and storage of the layout data. 5) LayoutParser\\nis also highly customizable, via its integration with functions for layout data\\nannotation and model training. We now provide detailed descriptions for each\\ncomponent.\\n\\n3.1 Layout Detection Models\\n\\nIn LayoutParser, a layout model takes a document image as an input and\\ngenerates a list of rectangular boxes for the target content regions. Diﬀerent\\nfrom traditional methods, it relies on deep convolutional neural networks rather\\nthan manually curated rules to identify content regions. It is formulated as an\\nobject detection problem and state-of-the-art models like Faster R-CNN [28] and\\nMask R-CNN [12] are used. This yields prediction results of high accuracy and\\nmakes it possible to build a concise, generalized interface for layout detection.\\nLayoutParser, built upon Detectron2 [35], provides a minimal API that can\\nperform layout detection with only four lines of code in Python:\\n\\n1 import layoutparser as lp\\n2 image = cv2 . imread ( \" image_file \" ) # load images\\n3 model = lp . De t e c tro n2 Lay outM odel (\\n\\n\" lp :// PubLayNet / f as t er _ r c nn _ R _ 50 _ F P N_ 3 x / config \" )\\n\\n4\\n5 layout = model . detect ( image )\\n\\nLayoutParser provides a wealth of pre-trained model weights using various\\ndatasets covering diﬀerent languages, time periods, and document types. Due to\\ndomain shift [7], the prediction performance can notably drop when models are ap-\\nplied to target samples that are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the training dataset. As\\ndocument structures and layouts vary greatly in diﬀerent domains, it is important\\nto select models trained on a dataset similar to the test samples. A semantic syntax\\nis used for initializing the model weights in LayoutParser, using both the dataset\\nname and model name lp://<dataset-name>/<model-architecture-name>.\\n\\n\\x0c6\\n\\nZ. Shen et al.\\n\\nFig. 2: The relationship between the three types of layout data structures.\\nCoordinate supports three kinds of variation; TextBlock consists of the co-\\nordinate information and extra features like block text, types, and reading orders;\\na Layout object is a list of all possible layout elements, including other Layout\\nobjects. They all support the same set of transformation and operation APIs for\\nmaximum ﬂexibility.\\n\\nShown in Table 1, LayoutParser currently hosts 9 pre-trained models trained\\non 5 diﬀerent datasets. Description of the training dataset is provided alongside\\nwith the trained models such that users can quickly identify the most suitable\\nmodels for their tasks. Additionally, when such a model is not readily available,\\nLayoutParser also supports training customized layout models and community\\nsharing of the models (detailed in Section 3.5).\\n\\n3.2 Layout Data Structures\\n\\nA critical feature of LayoutParser is the implementation of a series of data\\nstructures and operations that can be used to eﬃciently process and manipulate\\nthe layout elements. In document image analysis pipelines, various post-processing\\non the layout analysis model outputs is usually required to obtain the ﬁnal\\noutputs. Traditionally, this requires exporting DL model outputs and then loading\\nthe results into other pipelines. All model outputs from LayoutParser will be\\nstored in carefully engineered data types optimized for further processing, which\\nmakes it possible to build an end-to-end document digitization pipeline within\\nLayoutParser. There are three key components in the data structure, namely\\nthe Coordinate system, the TextBlock, and the Layout. They provide diﬀerent\\nlevels of abstraction for the layout data, and a set of APIs are supported for\\ntransformations or operations on these classes.\\n\\n\\x0cLayoutParser: A Uniﬁed Toolkit for DL-Based DIA\\n\\n7\\n\\nCoordinates are the cornerstones for storing layout information. Currently,\\nthree types of Coordinate data structures are provided in LayoutParser, shown\\nin Figure 2. Interval and Rectangle are the most common data types and\\nsupport specifying 1D or 2D regions within a document. They are parameterized\\nwith 2 and 4 parameters. A Quadrilateral class is also implemented to support\\na more generalized representation of rectangular regions when the document\\nis skewed or distorted, where the 4 corner points can be speciﬁed and a total\\nof 8 degrees of freedom are supported. A wide collection of transformations\\nlike shift, pad, and scale, and operations like intersect, union, and is_in,\\nare supported for these classes. Notably, it is common to separate a segment\\nof the image and analyze it individually. LayoutParser provides full support\\nfor this scenario via image cropping operations crop_image and coordinate\\ntransformations like relative_to and condition_on that transform coordinates\\nto and from their relative representations. We refer readers to Table 2 for a more\\ndetailed description of these operations13.\\n\\nBased on Coordinates, we implement the TextBlock class that stores both\\nthe positional and extra features of individual layout elements. It also supports\\nspecifying the reading orders via setting the parent ﬁeld to the index of the parent\\nobject. A Layout class is built that takes in a list of TextBlocks and supports\\nprocessing the elements in batch. Layout can also be nested to support hierarchical\\nlayout structures. They support the same operations and transformations as the\\nCoordinate classes, minimizing both learning and deployment eﬀort.\\n\\n3.3 OCR\\n\\nLayoutParser provides a uniﬁed interface for existing OCR tools. Though there\\nare many OCR tools available, they are usually conﬁgured diﬀerently with distinct\\nAPIs or protocols for using them. It can be ineﬃcient to add new OCR tools into\\nan existing pipeline, and diﬃcult to make direct comparisons among the available\\ntools to ﬁnd the best option for a particular project. To this end, LayoutParser\\nbuilds a series of wrappers among existing OCR engines, and provides nearly\\nthe same syntax for using them. It supports a plug-and-play style of using OCR\\nengines, making it eﬀortless to switch, evaluate, and compare diﬀerent OCR\\nmodules:\\n\\n1 ocr_agent = lp . TesseractAgent ()\\n2 # Can be easily switched to other OCR software\\n3 tokens = ocr_agent . detect ( image )\\n\\nThe OCR outputs will also be stored in the aforementioned layout data\\nstructures and can be seamlessly incorporated into the digitization pipeline.\\nCurrently LayoutParser supports the Tesseract and Google Cloud Vision OCR\\nengines.\\n\\nLayoutParser also comes with a DL-based CNN-RNN OCR model [6] trained\\nwith the Connectionist Temporal Classiﬁcation (CTC) loss [10]. It can be used\\nlike the other OCR modules, and can be easily trained on customized datasets.\\n\\n13 This is also available in the LayoutParser documentation pages.\\n\\n\\x0c8\\n\\nZ.

LayoutParser supports exporting layout data into diﬀerent\\nformats like JSON, csv, and will add the support for the METS/ALTO XML\\nformat 14 . It can also load datasets from layout analysis-speciﬁc formats like\\nCOCO [38] and the Page Format [25] for training layout models (Section 3.5).\\nVisualization of the layout detection results is critical for both presentation\\nand debugging. LayoutParser is built with an integrated API for displaying the\\nlayout information along with the original document image. Shown in Figure 3, it\\nenables presenting layout data with rich meta information and features in diﬀerent\\nmodes. More detailed information can be found in the online LayoutParser\\ndocumentation page.\\n\\n3.5 Customized Model Training\\n\\nBesides the oﬀ-the-shelf library, LayoutParser is also highly customizable with\\nsupports for highly unique and challenging document analysis tasks. Target\\ndocument images can be vastly diﬀerent from the existing datasets for train-\\ning layout models, which leads to low layout detection accuracy. Training data\\n\\n14 https://altoxml.github.io\\n\\n\\x0cLayoutParser: A Uniﬁed Toolkit for DL-Based DIA\\n\\n9\\n\\nFig. 3: Layout detection and OCR results visualization generated by the\\nLayoutParser APIs. Mode I directly overlays the layout region bounding boxes\\nand categories over the original image. Mode II recreates the original document\\nvia drawing the OCR’d texts at their corresponding positions on the image\\ncanvas. In this ﬁgure, tokens in textual regions are ﬁltered using the API and\\nthen displayed.\\n\\ncan also be highly sensitive and not sharable publicly. To overcome these chal-\\nlenges, LayoutParser is built with rich features for eﬃcient data annotation and\\ncustomized model training.\\n\\nLayoutParser incorporates a toolkit optimized for annotating document lay-\\nouts using object-level active learning [32]. With the help from a layout detection\\nmodel trained along with labeling, only the most important layout objects within\\neach image, rather than the whole image, are required for labeling. The rest of\\nthe regions are automatically annotated with high conﬁdence predictions from\\nthe layout detection model. This allows a layout dataset to be created more\\neﬃciently with only around 60% of the labeling budget.\\n\\nAfter the training dataset is curated, LayoutParser supports diﬀerent modes\\nfor training the layout models. Fine-tuning can be used for training models on a\\nsmall newly-labeled dataset by initializing the model with existing pre-trained\\nweights. Training from scratch can be helpful when the source dataset and\\ntarget are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent and a large training set is available. However, as\\nsuggested in Studer et al.’s work[33], loading pre-trained weights on large-scale\\ndatasets like ImageNet [5], even from totally diﬀerent domains, can still boost\\nmodel performance. Through the integrated API provided by LayoutParser,\\nusers can easily compare model performances on the benchmark datasets.\\n\\n\\x0c10\\n\\nZ. Shen et al.\\n\\nFig. 4: Illustration of (a) the original historical Japanese document with layout\\ndetection results and (b) a recreated version of the document image that achieves\\nmuch better character recognition recall. The reorganization algorithm rearranges\\nthe tokens based on the their detected bounding boxes given a maximum allowed\\nheight.\\n\\n4 LayoutParser Community Platform\\n\\nAnother focus of LayoutParser is promoting the reusability of layout detection\\nmodels and full digitization pipelines. Similar to many existing deep learning\\nlibraries, LayoutParser comes with a community model hub for distributing\\nlayout models. End-users can upload their self-trained models to the model hub,\\nand these models can be loaded into a similar interface as the currently available\\nLayoutParser pre-trained models. For example, the model trained on the News\\nNavigator dataset [17] has been incorporated in the model hub.\\n\\nBeyond DL models, LayoutParser also promotes the sharing of entire doc-\\nument digitization pipelines. For example, sometimes the pipeline requires the\\ncombination of multiple DL models to achieve better accuracy. Currently, pipelines\\nare mainly described in academic papers and implementations are often not pub-\\nlicly available. To this end, the LayoutParser community platform also enables\\nthe sharing of layout pipelines to promote the discussion and reuse of techniques.\\nFor each shared pipeline, it has a dedicated project page, with links to the source\\ncode, documentation, and an outline of the approaches. A discussion panel is\\nprovided for exchanging ideas. Combined with the core LayoutParser library,\\nusers can easily build reusable components based on the shared pipelines and\\napply them to solve their unique problems.\\n\\n5 Use Cases\\n\\nThe core objective of LayoutParser is to make it easier to create both large-scale\\nand light-weight document digitization pipelines. Large-scale document processing\\n\\n\\x0cLayoutParser: A Uniﬁed Toolkit for DL-Based DIA\\n\\n11\\n\\nfocuses on precision, eﬃciency, and robustness. The target documents may have\\ncomplicated structures, and may require training multiple layout detection models\\nto achieve the optimal accuracy. Light-weight pipelines are built for relatively\\nsimple documents, with an emphasis on development ease, speed and ﬂexibility.\\nIdeally one only needs to use existing resources, and model training should be\\navoided. Through two exemplar projects, we show how practitioners in both\\nacademia and industry can easily build such pipelines using LayoutParser and\\nextract high-quality structured document data for their downstream tasks. The\\nsource code for these projects will be publicly available in the LayoutParser\\ncommunity hub.\\n\\n5.1 A Comprehensive Historical Document Digitization Pipeline\\n\\nThe digitization of historical documents can unlock valuable data that can shed\\nlight on many important social, economic, and historical questions. Yet due to\\nscan noises, page wearing, and the prevalence of complicated layout structures, ob-\\ntaining a structured representation of historical document scans is often extremely\\ncomplicated.\\nIn this example, LayoutParser was\\nused to develop a comprehensive\\npipeline, shown in Figure 5, to gener-\\nate high-quality structured data from\\nhistorical Japanese ﬁrm ﬁnancial ta-\\nbles with complicated layouts. The\\npipeline applies two layout models to\\nidentify diﬀerent levels of document\\nstructures and two customized OCR\\nengines for optimized character recog-\\nnition accuracy.\\n\\nAs shown in Figure 4 (a), the\\ndocument contains columns of text\\nwritten vertically 15, a common style\\nin Japanese. Due to scanning noise\\nand archaic printing technology, the\\ncolumns can be skewed or have vari-\\nable widths, and hence cannot be eas-\\nily identiﬁed via rule-based methods.\\nWithin each column, words are sepa-\\nrated by white spaces of variable size,\\nand the vertical positions of objects\\ncan be an indicator of their layout\\ntype.\\n\\nFig. 5: Illustration of how LayoutParser\\nhelps with the historical document digi-\\ntization pipeline.\\n\\n15 A document page consists of eight rows like this. For simplicity we skip the row\\n\\nsegmentation discussion and refer readers to the source code when available.\\n\\n\\x0c12\\n\\nZ. Shen et al.\\n\\nTo decipher the complicated layout\\n\\nstructure, two object detection models have been trained to recognize individual\\ncolumns and tokens, respectively. A small training set (400 images with approxi-\\nmately 100 annotations each) is curated via the active learning based annotation\\ntool [32] in LayoutParser. The models learn to identify both the categories and\\nregions for each token or column via their distinct visual features. The layout\\ndata structure enables easy grouping of the tokens within each column, and\\nrearranging columns to achieve the correct reading orders based on the horizontal\\nposition. Errors are identiﬁed and rectiﬁed via checking the consistency of the\\nmodel predictions. Therefore, though trained on a small dataset, the pipeline\\nachieves a high level of layout detection accuracy: it achieves a 96.97 AP [19]\\nscore across 5 categories for the column detection model, and a 89.23 AP across\\n4 categories for the token detection model.\\n\\nA combination of character recognition methods is developed to tackle the\\nunique challenges in this document. In our experiments, we found that irregular\\nspacing between the tokens led to a low character recognition recall rate, whereas\\nexisting OCR models tend to perform better on densely-arranged texts. To\\novercome this challenge, we create a document reorganization algorithm that\\nrearranges the text based on the token bounding boxes detected in the layout\\nanalysis step. Figure 4 (b) illustrates the generated image of dense text, which is\\nsent to the OCR APIs as a whole to reduce the transaction costs. The ﬂexible\\ncoordinate system in LayoutParser is used to transform the OCR results relative\\nto their original positions on the page.\\n\\nAdditionally, it is common for historical documents to use unique fonts\\nwith diﬀerent glyphs, which signiﬁcantly degrades the accuracy of OCR models\\ntrained on modern texts. In this document, a special ﬂat font is used for printing\\nnumbers and could not be detected by oﬀ-the-shelf OCR engines. Using the highly\\nﬂexible functionalities from LayoutParser, a pipeline approach is constructed\\nthat achieves a high recognition accuracy with minimal eﬀort. As the characters\\nhave unique visual structures and are usually clustered together, we train the\\nlayout model to identify number regions with a dedicated category. Subsequently,\\nLayoutParser crops images within these regions, and identiﬁes characters within\\nthem using a self-trained OCR model based on a CNN-RNN [6]. The model\\ndetects a total of 15 possible categories, and achieves a 0.98 Jaccard score16 and\\na 0.17 average Levinstein distances17 for token prediction on the test set.\\n\\nOverall, it is possible to create an intricate and highly accurate digitization\\npipeline for large-scale digitization using LayoutParser. The pipeline avoids\\nspecifying the complicated rules used in traditional methods, is straightforward\\nto develop, and is robust to outliers. The DL models also generate ﬁne-grained\\nresults that enable creative approaches like page reorganization for OCR.\\n\\n16 This measures the overlap between the detected and ground-truth characters, and\\n\\nthe maximum is 1.\\n\\n17 This measures the number of edits from the ground-truth text to the predicted text,\\n\\nand lower is better.\\n\\n\\x0cLayoutParser: A Uniﬁed Toolkit for DL-Based DIA\\n\\n13\\n\\nFig. 6: This lightweight table detector can identify tables (outlined in red) and\\ncells (shaded in blue) in diﬀerent locations on a page. In very few cases (d), it\\nmight generate minor error predictions, e.g, failing to capture the top text line of\\na table.\\n\\n5.2 A light-weight Visual Table Extractor\\n\\nDetecting tables and parsing their structures (table extraction) are of central im-\\nportance for many document digitization tasks. Many previous works [26, 30, 27]\\nand tools 18 have been developed to identify and parse table structures. Yet they\\nmight require training complicated models from scratch, or are only applicable\\nfor born-digital PDF documents. In this section, we show how LayoutParser can\\nhelp build a light-weight accurate visual table extractor for legal docket tables\\nusing the existing resources with minimal eﬀort.\\n\\nThe extractor uses a pre-trained layout detection model for identifying the\\ntable regions and some simple rules for pairing the rows and the columns in the\\nPDF image. Mask R-CNN [12] trained on the PubLayNet dataset [38] from the\\nLayoutParser Model Zoo can be used for detecting table regions. By ﬁltering\\nout model predictions of low conﬁdence and removing overlapping predictions,\\nLayoutParser can identify the tabular regions on each page, which signiﬁcantly\\nsimpliﬁes the subsequent steps. By applying the line detection functions within\\nthe tabular segments, provided in the utility module from LayoutParser, the\\npipeline can identify the three distinct columns in the tables. A row clustering\\nmethod is then applied via analyzing the y coordinates of token bounding boxes in\\nthe left-most column, which are obtained from the OCR engines. A non-maximal\\nsuppression algorithm is used to remove duplicated rows with extremely small\\ngaps. Shown in Figure 6, the built pipeline can detect tables at diﬀerent positions\\non a page accurately. Continued tables from diﬀerent pages are concatenated,\\nand a structured table representation has been easily created.\\n\\n18 https://github.com/atlanhq/camelot, https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula\\n\\n\\x0c14\\n\\nZ. Shen et al.\\n\\n6 Conclusion\\n\\nLayoutParser provides a comprehensive toolkit for deep learning-based document\\nimage analysis. The oﬀ-the-shelf library is easy to install, and can be used to\\nbuild ﬂexible and accurate pipelines for processing documents with complicated\\nstructures. It also supports high-level customization and enables easy labeling and\\ntraining of DL models on unique document image datasets. The LayoutParser\\ncommunity platform facilitates sharing DL models and DIA pipelines, inviting\\ndiscussion and promoting code reproducibility and reusability. The LayoutParser\\nteam is committed to keeping the library updated continuously and bringing\\nthe most recent advances in DL-based DIA, such as multi-modal document\\nmodeling [37, 36, 9] (an upcoming priority), to a diverse audience of end-users.\\n\\nAcknowledgements We thank the anonymous reviewers for their comments\\nand suggestions.

font-size:8px\">Abstract. </span><span style=\"font-family: CMR9; font-size:8px\">Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been\\n<br>primarily driven by the application of neural networks. Ideally, research\\n<br>outcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further\\n<br>investigation. However, various factors like loosely organized codebases\\n<br>and sophisticated model conﬁgurations complicate the easy reuse of im-\\n<br>portant innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going\\n<br>eﬀorts to improve reusability and simplify deep learning (DL) model\\n<br>development in disciplines like natural language processing and computer\\n<br>vision, none of them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA.\\n<br>This represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA is central to\\n<br>academic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences\\n<br>and humanities. This paper introduces </span><span style=\"font-family: CMTT9; font-size:8px\">LayoutParser</span><span style=\"font-family: CMR9; font-size:8px\">, an open-source\\n<br>library for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applica-\\n<br>tions. The core </span><span style=\"font-family: CMTT9; font-size:8px\">LayoutParser </span><span style=\"font-family: CMR9; font-size:8px\">library comes with a set of simple and\\n<br>intuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models for layout de-\\n<br>tection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks.\\n<br>To promote extensibility, </span><span style=\"font-family: CMTT9; font-size:8px\">LayoutParser </span><span style=\"font-family: CMR9; font-size:8px\">also incorporates a community\\n<br>platform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digiti-\\n<br></span><span style=\"font-family: CMR9; font-size:8px\">zation pipelines. We demonstrate that </span><span style=\"font-family: CMTT9; font-size:8px\">LayoutParser </span><span style=\"font-family: CMR9; font-size:8px\">is helpful for both\\n<br>lightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines in real-word use cases.\\n<br>The library is publicly available at </span><span style=\"font-family: CMTT9; font-size:8px\">https://layout-parser.github.io</span><span style=\"font-family: CMR9; font-size:8px\">.\\n<br></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:162px; top:627px; width:289px; height:21px;\"><span style=\"font-family: CMBX9; font-size:8px\">Keywords: </span><span style=\"font-family: CMR9; font-size:8px\">Document Image Analysis </span><span style=\"font-family: SFRM0900; font-size:8px\">· </span><span style=\"font-family: CMR9; font-size:8px\">Deep Learning </span><span style=\"font-family: SFRM0900; font-size:8px\">· </span><span style=\"font-family: CMR9; font-size:8px\">Layout Analysis\\n<br></span><span style=\"font-family: SFRM0900; font-size:8px\">· </span><span style=\"font-family: CMR9; font-size:8px\">Character Recognition </span><span style=\"font-family: SFRM0900; font-size:8px\">· </span><span style=\"font-family: CMR9; font-size:8px\">Open Source library </span><span style=\"font-family: SFRM0900; font-size:8px\">· </span><span style=\"font-family: CMR9; font-size:8px\">Toolkit.\\n<br></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:134px; top:669px; width:6px; height:11px;\"><span style=\"font-family: CMBX12; font-size:11px\">1\\n<br></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:154px; top:669px; width:74px; height:11px;\"><span style=\"font-family: CMBX12; font-size:11px\">Introduction\\n<br></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:134px; top:692px; width:347px; height:21px;\"><span style=\"font-family: CMR10; font-size:9px\">Deep Learning(DL)-based approaches are the state-of-the-art for a wide range of\\n<br></span><span style=\"font-family: CMR10; font-size:9px\">document image analysis (DIA) tasks including document image classiﬁcation [11,\\n<br></span></div><span style=\"position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:287px; top:293px; width:2px; height:0px;\"></span>\\n<span style=\"position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:292px; top:315px; width:2px; height:0px;\"></span>\\n<span style=\"font-family: Times-Roman; font-size:5px\"> \\n<br> \\n<br> \\n<br> \\n<br> \\n<br> \\n<br><span style=\"position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:892px; width:612px; height:792px;\"></span>\\n<div style=\"position:absolute; top:892px;\"><a name=\"2\">Page 2</a></div>\\n<div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:134px; top:984px; width:4px; height:8px;\"><span style=\"font-family: CMR9; font-size:8px\">2\\n<br></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:167px; top:984px; width:54px; height:8px;\"><span style=\"font-family: CMR9; font-size:8px\">Z.

DL has the potential to transform DIA pipelines and beneﬁt a broad\\n<br>spectrum of large-scale document digitization projects.\\n<br></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:134px; top:1069px; width:348px; height:213px;\"><span style=\"font-family: CMR10; font-size:9px\">However, there are several practical diﬃculties for taking advantages of re-\\n<br>cent advances in DL-based methods: 1) DL models are notoriously convoluted\\n<br>for reuse and extension. Existing models are developed using distinct frame-\\n<br>works like TensorFlow [1] or PyTorch [24], and the high-level parameters can\\n<br>be obfuscated by implementation details [8]. It can be a time-consuming and\\n<br>frustrating experience to debug, reproduce, and adapt existing models for DIA,\\n<br>and </span><span style=\"font-family: CMTI10; font-size:9px\">many researchers who would beneﬁt the most from using these methods lack\\n<br>the technical background to implement them from scratch. </span><span style=\"font-family: CMR10; font-size:9px\">2) Document images\\n<br></span><span style=\"font-family: CMR10; font-size:9px\">contain diverse and disparate patterns across domains, and customized training\\n<br></span><span style=\"font-family: CMR10; font-size:9px\">is often required to achieve a desirable detection accuracy. Currently </span><span style=\"font-family: CMTI10; font-size:9px\">there is no\\n<br>full-ﬂedged infrastructure for easily curating the target document image datasets\\n<br>and ﬁne-tuning or re-training the models. </span><span style=\"font-family: CMR10; font-size:9px\">3) DIA usually requires a sequence of\\n<br>models and other processing to obtain the ﬁnal outputs. Often research teams use\\n<br>DL models and then perform further document analyses in separate processes,\\n<br>and these pipelines are not documented in any central location (and often not\\n<br>documented at all). This makes it </span><span style=\"font-family: CMTI10; font-size:9px\">diﬃcult for research teams to learn about how\\n<br>full pipelines are implemented </span><span style=\"font-family: CMR10; font-size:9px\">and </span><span style=\"font-family: CMTI10; font-size:9px\">leads them to invest signiﬁcant resources in\\n<br>reinventing the DIA wheel</span><span style=\"font-family: CMR10; font-size:9px\">.\\n<br></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:134px; top:1284px; width:346px; height:33px;\"><span style=\"font-family: CMTT10; font-size:9px\">LayoutParser </span><span style=\"font-family: CMR10; font-size:9px\">provides a uniﬁed toolkit to support DL-based document image\\n<br>analysis and processing.

The dhSegment [22] utilizes fully convolutional networks [20] for segmen-\\n<br>tation tasks on historical documents. Object detection-based methods like Faster\\n<br>R-CNN [28] and Mask R-CNN [12] are used for identifying document elements [38]\\n<br>and detecting tables [30, 26]. Most recently, Graph Neural Networks [29] have also\\n<br>been used in table detection [27]. However, these models are usually implemented\\n<br>individually and there is no uniﬁed framework to load and use such models.\\n<br></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:134px; top:2100px; width:348px; height:189px;\"><span style=\"font-family: CMR10; font-size:9px\">There has been a surge of interest in creating open-source tools for document\\n<br>image processing: a search of </span><span style=\"font-family: CMTT10; font-size:9px\">document image analysis </span><span style=\"font-family: CMR10; font-size:9px\">in Github leads to 5M\\n<br>relevant code pieces </span><span style=\"font-family: CMR7; font-size:6px\">6</span><span style=\"font-family: CMR10; font-size:9px\">; yet most of them rely on traditional rule-based methods\\n<br>or provide limited functionalities. The closest prior research to our work is the\\n<br>OCR-D project</span><span style=\"font-family: CMR7; font-size:6px\">7</span><span style=\"font-family: CMR10; font-size:9px\">, which also tries to build a complete toolkit for DIA. However,\\n<br>similar to the platform developed by Neudecker et al. [21], it is designed for\\n<br>analyzing historical documents, and provides no supports for recent DL models.\\n<br>The </span><span style=\"font-family: CMTT10; font-size:9px\">DocumentLayoutAnalysis </span><span style=\"font-family: CMR10; font-size:9px\">project</span><span style=\"font-family: CMR7; font-size:6px\">8 </span><span style=\"font-family: CMR10; font-size:9px\">focuses on processing born-digital PDF\\n<br>documents via analyzing the stored PDF data. Repositories like </span><span style=\"font-family: CMTT10; font-size:9px\">DeepLayout</span><span style=\"font-family: CMR7; font-size:6px\">9\\n<br></span><span style=\"font-family: CMR10; font-size:9px\">and </span><span style=\"font-family: CMTT10; font-size:9px\">Detectron2-PubLayNet</span><span style=\"font-family: CMR7; font-size:6px\">10 </span><span style=\"font-family: CMR10; font-size:9px\">are individual deep learning models trained on\\n<br>layout analysis datasets without support for the full DIA pipeline.

For example, sometimes the pipeline requires the\\n<br>combination of multiple DL models to achieve better accuracy. Currently, pipelines\\n<br>are mainly described in academic papers and implementations are often not pub-\\n<br>licly available. To this end, the </span><span style=\"font-family: CMTT10; font-size:9px\">LayoutParser </span><span style=\"font-family: CMR10; font-size:9px\">community platform also enables\\n<br></span><span style=\"font-family: CMR10; font-size:9px\">the sharing of layout pipelines to promote the discussion and reuse of techniques.\\n<br>For each shared pipeline, it has a dedicated project page, with links to the source\\n<br>code, documentation, and an outline of the approaches.

A small training set (400 images with approxi-\\n<br>mately 100 annotations each) is curated via the active learning based annotation\\n<br>tool [32] in </span><span style=\"font-family: CMTT10; font-size:9px\">LayoutParser</span><span style=\"font-family: CMR10; font-size:9px\">. The models learn to identify both the categories and\\n<br>regions for each token or column via their distinct visual features. The layout\\n<br>data structure enables easy grouping of the tokens within each column, and\\n<br>rearranging columns to achieve the correct reading orders based on the horizontal\\n<br>position. Errors are identiﬁed and rectiﬁed via checking the consistency of the\\n<br>model predictions. Therefore, though trained on a small dataset, the pipeline\\n<br>achieves a high level of layout detection accuracy: it achieves a 96.97 AP [19]\\n<br>score across 5 categories for the column detection model, and a 89.23 AP across\\n<br>4 categories for the token detection model.\\n<br></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:134px; top:9587px; width:346px; height:117px;\"><span style=\"font-family: CMR10; font-size:9px\">A combination of character recognition methods is developed to tackle the\\n<br>unique challenges in this document. In our experiments, we found that irregular\\n<br>spacing between the tokens led to a low character recognition recall rate, whereas\\n<br>existing OCR models tend to perform better on densely-arranged texts. To\\n<br>overcome this challenge, we create a document reorganization algorithm that\\n<br>rearranges the text based on the token bounding boxes detected in the layout\\n<br>analysis step. Figure 4 (b) illustrates the generated image of dense text, which is\\n<br>sent to the OCR APIs as a whole to reduce the transaction costs. The ﬂexible\\n<br>coordinate system in </span><span style=\"font-family: CMTT10; font-size:9px\">LayoutParser </span><span style=\"font-family: CMR10; font-size:9px\">is used to transform the OCR results relative\\n<br>to their original positions on the page.\\n<br></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:134px; top:9710px; width:347px; height:141px;\"><span style=\"font-family: CMR10; font-size:9px\">Additionally, it is common for historical documents to use unique fonts\\n<br>with diﬀerent glyphs, which signiﬁcantly degrades the accuracy of OCR models\\n<br>trained on modern texts. In this document, a special ﬂat font is used for printing\\n<br>numbers and could not be detected by oﬀ-the-shelf OCR engines. Using the highly\\n<br>ﬂexible functionalities from </span><span style=\"font-family: CMTT10; font-size:9px\">LayoutParser</span><span style=\"font-family: CMR10; font-size:9px\">, a pipeline approach is constructed\\n<br>that achieves a high recognition accuracy with minimal eﬀort. As the characters\\n<br>have unique visual structures and are usually clustered together, we train the\\n<br>layout model to identify number regions with a dedicated category.

Many previous works [26, 30, 27]\\n<br>and tools </span><span style=\"font-family: CMR7; font-size:6px\">18 </span><span style=\"font-family: CMR10; font-size:9px\">have been developed to identify and parse table structures. Yet they\\n<br>might require training complicated models from scratch, or are only applicable\\n<br>for born-digital PDF documents. In this section, we show how </span><span style=\"font-family: CMTT10; font-size:9px\">LayoutParser </span><span style=\"font-family: CMR10; font-size:9px\">can\\n<br>help build a light-weight accurate visual table extractor for legal docket tables\\n<br>using the existing resources with minimal eﬀort.\\n<br></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:134px; top:10606px; width:347px; height:177px;\"><span style=\"font-family: CMR10; font-size:9px\">The extractor uses a pre-trained layout detection model for identifying the\\n<br>table regions and some simple rules for pairing the rows and the columns in the\\n<br>PDF image. Mask R-CNN [12] trained on the PubLayNet dataset [38] from the\\n<br></span><span style=\"font-family: CMTT10; font-size:9px\">LayoutParser </span><span style=\"font-family: CMR10; font-size:9px\">Model Zoo can be used for detecting table regions. By ﬁltering\\n<br>out model predictions of low conﬁdence and removing overlapping predictions,\\n<br></span><span style=\"font-family: CMTT10; font-size:9px\">LayoutParser </span><span style=\"font-family: CMR10; font-size:9px\">can identify the tabular regions on each page, which signiﬁcantly\\n<br>simpliﬁes the subsequent steps. By applying the line detection functions within\\n<br></span><span style=\"font-family: CMR10; font-size:9px\">the tabular segments, provided in the utility module from </span><span style=\"font-family: CMTT10; font-size:9px\">LayoutParser</span><span style=\"font-family: CMR10; font-size:9px\">, the\\n<br>pipeline can identify the three distinct columns in the tables. A row clustering\\n<br>method is then applied via analyzing the y coordinates of token bounding boxes in\\n<br>the left-most column, which are obtained from the OCR engines. A non-maximal\\n<br>suppression algorithm is used to remove duplicated rows with extremely small\\n<br>gaps. Shown in Figure 6, the built pipeline can detect tables at diﬀerent positions\\n<br>on a page accurately. Continued tables from diﬀerent pages are concatenated,\\n<br>and a structured table representation has been easily created.\\n<br></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:133px; top:10808px; width:315px; height:10px;\"><span style=\"font-family: CMR6; font-size:5px\">18 </span><span style=\"font-family: CMR9; font-size:8px\">https://github.com/atlanhq/camelot, https://github.com/tabulapdf/tabula\\n<br></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: figure 1px solid; writing-mode:False; left:134px; top:10269px; width:345px; height:118px;\"></div><span style=\"position:absolute; border: black 1px solid; left:134px; top:10806px; width:56px; height:0px;\"></span>\\n<span style=\"position:absolute; border: gray 1px solid; left:0px; top:10996px; width:612px; height:792px;\"></span>\\n<div style=\"position:absolute; top:10996px;\"><a name=\"14\">Page 14</a></div>\\n<div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:134px; top:11088px; width:9px; height:8px;\"><span style=\"font-family: CMR9; font-size:8px\">14\\n<br></span></div><div style=\"position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:167px; top:11088px; width:54px; height:8px;\"><span style=\"font-family: CMR9; font-size:8px\">Z.
